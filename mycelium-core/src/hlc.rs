//! Hybrid Logical Clock (HLC) used to stamp every locally-originated update
//! and to observe remote stamps as they arrive.
//!
//! The clock is packed into a `u64`:
//!
//! - **High 48 bits**: physical Unix-millisecond time. Good through year 8901.
//! - **Low 16 bits**: logical counter. Up to 65 535 events per millisecond
//!   per node before saturation.
//!
//! This packing is deliberate: comparisons on the raw `u64` are also
//! comparisons on the (physical, logical) tuple in lexicographic order, so
//! the existing `>`-based LWW comparison in `apply_and_notify` continues to
//! work unchanged when the timestamp field is reinterpreted as HLC. Higher
//! physical always beats lower physical regardless of logical; with equal
//! physical, higher logical wins.
//!
//! ## Algorithm (Kulkarni et al. 2014)
//!
//! For a local event:
//!
//! ```text
//! next.phys    = max(prev.phys, wall_now_ms)
//! next.logical = if next.phys == prev.phys { prev.logical + 1 } else { 0 }
//! ```
//!
//! For an observed remote event with timestamp `r`:
//!
//! ```text
//! next.phys    = max(prev.phys, r.phys, wall_now_ms)
//! next.logical = match (next.phys ==) {
//!   prev.phys && r.phys => max(prev.logical, r.logical) + 1,
//!   prev.phys           => prev.logical + 1,
//!   r.phys              => r.logical + 1,
//!   neither             => 0,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This guarantees that any locally-originated update following an observed
//! remote update has a strictly greater HLC than the remote one — so causal
//! happens-before is preserved even under wall-clock skew.
//!
//! ## Documented limits
//!
//! - **Logical counter saturation.** The low 16 bits cap the logical at
//!   `65 535` events per ms per node. `tick()` saturates rather than
//!   wrapping, so on a node sustained at >65 k local events/ms the
//!   physical part takes over (every saturating-tick acts as if the wall
//!   clock advanced by 1 ms). Ordering stays correct; resolution degrades
//!   gracefully. Widening to a larger logical (e.g. 44+20) would require a
//!   wire-version bump and is deferred.
//!
//! - **Wall-clock forward jump.** Accepted unconditionally:
//!   `next.phys = max(prev.phys, wall_now_ms)` will jump the HLC ahead.
//!   Correctness for causal happens-before is unaffected. The
//!   `crate::seen` TTL eviction is keyed by `physical_ms`; a large
//!   forward jump can briefly age out the entire seen-set, allowing one
//!   round of duplicate admissions until the seen-set repopulates.
//!
//! - **Wall-clock backward jump.** `prev.phys` wins via `max`, so the HLC
//!   never goes backwards. Subsequent `wall_now_ms` reads return values
//!   smaller than `prev.phys`; the logical counter increments instead,
//!   maintaining strict monotonicity. The HLC is "self-correcting" against
//!   transient backward jumps but cannot recover lost time once the clock
//!   resyncs forward again.
//!
//! - **Remote drift bound.** `observe` clamps the *remote* physical time to
//!   `wall_now_ms + max_drift_ms` (default 5 minutes,
//!   [`DEFAULT_MAX_CLOCK_DRIFT_MS`]; configurable via
//!   `GossipConfig::max_clock_drift_ms`, `0` disables). Without the clamp a
//!   single peer with a far-future clock dragged every node's HLC forward
//!   irrecoverably (`max` never decays), and read-side evaporation — the
//!   substrate's failure detector — was silently suspended for the full
//!   drift duration (M2 Run-19 finding; the Kulkarni et al. 2014 algorithm
//!   mandates exactly this bound). Clamping is rate-limit `warn!`ed.
//!
//!   **Documented trade-off:** for a stamp *beyond* the bound, the usual
//!   "local write after observe beats the remote" guarantee is deliberately
//!   waived — the poisoned entry would win LWW against local rewrites until
//!   the wall clock catches up. The capability layer independently
//!   quarantines such entries (its freshness check rejects stamps too far
//!   in the future), so failure detection no longer depends on this. Full
//!   inbound rejection of out-of-bound updates (store-level quarantine) is
//!   a candidate for the next wire-policy pass.
