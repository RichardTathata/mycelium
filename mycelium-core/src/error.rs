//! Error type for gossip protocol operations.
//!
//! All fallible public APIs return [`GossipError`]. Variants are fully typed so callers
//! can match specific failure modes without parsing strings:
//!
//! - **Configuration errors** ([`InvalidField`], [`FieldConflict`], [`NodeIdMismatch`]) are
//!   returned by `GossipAgent::start` and [`GossipConfig::validate`] when a config field
//!   has an invalid or conflicting value.
//! - **Framing errors** ([`FrameTooLarge`], [`UnsupportedWireVersion`]) surface when a TCP
//!   frame exceeds the size limit or arrives with an unsupported wire-protocol version.
//! - **Lifecycle errors** ([`AlreadyRunning`], [`Shutdown`]) are returned by
//!   `GossipAgent::start` when it is called in the wrong agent state.
//! - **I/O and parsing errors** ([`Io`], [`Toml`], [`Parse`]) wrap lower-level failures.
//!   `Io` is returned only during startup (TCP listener bind, WAL read, TLS setup) —
//!   runtime TCP connection errors are absorbed internally and visible via
//!   `system_stats().dropped_frames` and `peer_drop_counts()`, not through `GossipError`.
