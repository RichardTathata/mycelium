//! [`CoreCtx`] — the shared Layers I + II infrastructure bundle.
//!
//! Carries identity/config, the Layer I KV substrate, the Layer II signal mesh,
//! transport security, networking, and lifecycle handles — everything the gossip
//! connection handler and writer need. The full `mycelium` crate wraps this in its
//! `TaskCtx` (adding Layer III+) and derefs to it, so existing `ctx.<core-field>`
//! sites are unchanged.
//!
//! **Invariant:** `CoreCtx` never references a higher-layer type (philosophy §5a —
//! the substrate is never aware of the layers above it).
