///     `(physical_ms_48 << 16) | logical_16` rather than a raw wall-clock millisecond.
///     LWW comparisons are unchanged — `>` on the packed `u64` is still equivalent to

///     (never `SignedData`); since `Data` is variant 0 and `SignedData` is variant 5,
///     no WireMessageV9 shim is needed — v9 frames decode cleanly with the v10 decoder.
