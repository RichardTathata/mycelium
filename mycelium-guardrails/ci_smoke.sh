# v3.0 guardrails smoke: run the guardrail worked examples Docker-free and assert they demonstrate
# the guardrail story on the printed markers. Two demos:
#   · guardrail_wedge — the hard-prevention wedge end-to-end (a policy strength report, an
#     unauthorized agent structurally stopped at the provider gate, an authorized agent admitted, a
#     tamper-evident proof reconstructed by a neutral observer).
#   · guardrail_fleet — all THREE strength tiers actually firing in one constructive-domain co-op:
#     a boundary drop (Tier A), a denied tool blocked at a state transition (Tier B), and an
#     unauthorized caller rejected + sealed + proven (Tier C).
# Retry-hardened for constrained CI runners (each example binds ephemeral ports into one tls mesh).

# Verification policy rule 3: each case prints `@@case@@ <suite>::<case>` as it starts; --list names the
# `run_demo <example>` lines below without running them.
