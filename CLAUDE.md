# CLAUDE.md — Mycelium session on-ramp

Fast on-ramp for code-assistant sessions. This file is deliberately thin: it holds the
**workflow rules, the build/test gates, and the hottest invariants** — everything else
lives in the **LLM wiki** and the code canon it cites.

## What this is

Mycelium is an embedded, broker-less Rust library — a three-layer substrate for AI agent
fleets and storage replication: **I** gossip KV (LWW + HLC, Merkle anti-entropy) ·
**II** signal mesh (scoped events, admission boundaries, opacity) · **III** epidemic
consensus. Layers I+II are the `mycelium-core` crate; `mycelium` adds III, capabilities,
services, gateway, tls. It is a **library, not a platform** — no daemon, no control plane;
a cluster is emergent from network reachability (peer-exchange + CA admission — **not**
`cluster_name`, which is a cosmetic label). v2.0 complete (all 16 milestones, 2026-06-21); v2.1.0
2026-07-15 (`LockService`, CI-gated Docker suites, #164 lock fixes);
v2.2.0 2026-07-16 (five-pass adversarial self-audit, input-fuzz gate, identity-auth Phase 1a, `/ready`
fix); v2.3.0 2026-07-24 (the **SOC 2 audit-gap** MINOR: gateway TLS (`gateway_tls`) · audit export
(`AuditSink`) + retention checkpointing · `sys/identity` authentication (CA anchor → signed
`sys/identity-proof/` → `require_identity_proofs`, default-off) · rotate+revoke · GDPR crypto-shred
(`SubjectKeyRegistry`) — the shared-responsibility matrix is
`docs/operations/shared-responsibility-matrix.md`); **v2.4.0 released 2026-08-16** (tag `v2.4.0` —
the **wiki-substrate** MINOR: the git-as-truth `GitStore` (`git-store`, six-phase hardening with
recorded measurements) · `GitMirror` projection sink (`git-mirror`) · claim-check **bulk ingest**
(`submit_batch` + `POST /gateway/wiki/ingest` + py/ts SDK verbs) · pluggable `PageFormat` codec ·
curator failover over node-local stores — all additive, wire unchanged; records
`docs/design/transparency-council-substrate.md` + `docs/plans/council-substrate-hardening.md`;
first tagged release with the wasmtime RUSTSEC-2026-0222 fix); **v2.4.1 released 2026-09-04** (tag
`v2.4.1` — a **security PATCH**: merged `with_http_routes` routers now behind gateway auth + companion
scope families · wasmtime 46.0.3 (RUSTSEC-2026-0269) · h2 0.4.16 (RUSTSEC-2026-0258) · `FsStore`
erase serialization; wire unchanged, no API change; companions `mycelium-reason` 0.6.0 /
`mycelium-py` 0.2.3 on their own lines); **v2.4.2 released 2026-09-05** (tag `v2.4.2` — a
**security + durability PATCH** from one external review: `/mcp`, `/signals/{kind}`,
`/consensus/{slot}` behind gateway auth (`mcp:invoke`/`mesh:read`/`consensus:read`) · three P1
persistence fixes (snapshot merges the WAL tail, LWW replay, honest acks + forced fsync,
`Committed { persisted }` — the one API note: add `..` to an exhaustive `Committed` destructure) ·
`langgraph-checkpoint-mycelium` 0.1.1 async row selection; wire unchanged); wire **v12** (`PREV = 11`). Scopes are **`Cluster · Group · Individual`** (all / subset / one),
shared by `SignalScope` and consensus (`cluster_propose` / `group_propose`). *Renamed 2026-07-10:*
`System` → `Cluster` (wire-compatible; `system_propose` kept as a `#[deprecated]` alias, gateway
still accepts `"system"`); `system_stats()` is unrelated — node-local runtime state, not a scope.

## The wiki workflow (non-negotiable)

1. **Query first.** Start any task by reading [`docs/wiki/wiki.md`](docs/wiki/wiki.md) →
   the relevant section/pages. Don't re-derive what the wiki already states.
2. **Ingest on completion.** When finished work produces durable knowledge (new invariant,
   root-caused bug family, shipped workstream, revised position): update the page(s),
   refresh folder-notes, add one dated file to the section's `.log/`.
3. **Schema:** [`docs/wiki/AGENTS.md`](docs/wiki/AGENTS.md). **Code is canon** — the wiki
   cites `src/` rather than paraphrasing it; on conflict trust the code, then fix the page.
4. **Lint periodically** via the `/wiki-lint` skill — doc-vs-code verification first (the
   check that catches drifted claims like the Run-28 lock-table finding).

Private memory (`~/.claude/.../memory/`) holds user preferences and session state only —
promote durable project knowledge to the wiki.

## Build & test gates (run before pushing)

**`make check`** is the one-command pre-push gate — clippy across the feature matrix CI enforces
(feature-matrix + `--no-default-features` + core), ~3 min, no wasmtime. The `--no-default-features`
clippy is the catcher for the *feature-gated dead-code trap* (an item live only under
`gateway`/`metrics` is dead in a minimal build — CI's Gateway-free + WASM-host jobs). `make
check-full` adds the test suites + wasm-host clippy. The underlying set:

```bash
cargo test --lib --features tls,metrics,a2a,llm
cargo clippy --lib --tests -- -D warnings                 # default features — catches tls-only dead code
cargo clippy --lib --tests --features tls,metrics,a2a,llm -- -D warnings
cargo test --lib --features compliance
cargo test --lib --no-default-features --features gateway
cargo clippy -p mycelium-core --lib --tests -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --lib --no-default-features -- -D warnings   # catches the feature-gated dead-code trap
```

Companion crates: `cargo test -p mycelium-tuple-space --features gateway`, same for
`mycelium-blackboard` (+ clippy `--all-targets`). CI also gates `tsc --noEmit`, the AFN +
coop smokes, fuzz (non-PR), and `cargo audit`. **Never trust a memorised test count** — run
the suite. Scale suites: `make test-scale` (100 nodes), `test-scale-resilience`,
`test-scale-entries` — read the wiki's
[scale-tests page](docs/wiki/dev/testing/scale-tests.md) before interpreting failures
(Docker-bridge iptables ceiling, VM fatigue).

## Hot invariants (the ones that ship regressions when forgotten)

- **One lock per function**, flat acquisitions only — the [lock-order
  table](docs/wiki/dev/concurrency/lock-order.md) claims completeness: adding any
  `Mutex`/`RwLock` field means adding a row.
- **papaya:** `compute` closures retry-safe; never act on a stale read — the whole
  recurring race family, rules + reference impls in
  [lock-free-and-atomics](docs/wiki/dev/concurrency/lock-free-and-atomics.md).
- **Individual-scope forwarding is unconditional** (flood fallback); only *admission* is
  scoped. Do not "optimize" it away. The one carve-out is not precedent: a frame addressed
  to *this* node terminates here (routing at the terminal, #162) —
  [runtime-invariants](docs/wiki/dev/architecture/runtime-invariants.md).
- **Detection, not prevention:** never teach Layer I a higher-layer law (no prefix write
  guards in `apply_and_notify`) — tripwires + counters instead.
- **Consensus listeners register synchronously**; multi-node consensus tests need a
  listener on every node + a structural peer-ready poll (never fixed sleeps) —
  [testing](docs/wiki/dev/testing/testing.md).
- **KV writes are size-gated** (`framing::MAX_KV_WRITE_BYTES`); anti-entropy is chunked;
  a `FrameTooLarge` frame is dropped without tearing down the connection.
- **Apply to the store, then hand the record to the WAL** — never the reverse — and a WAL ack is
  a durability claim (`Err` when the writer is gone; `append_sync` fsyncs in every `SyncMode`).
  The snapshot merges the WAL tail before truncating; replay is LWW, not a watermark —
  [runtime-invariants](docs/wiki/dev/architecture/runtime-invariants.md) §Persistence.
- Ports via `test_util::alloc_port`; env-var tests hold `config::tests::env_test_lock()`.

## Active work

All engineering plans shipped as of 2026-06-21 (`docs/plans/README.md`); **Legible Emergence**
completed 2026-07-03 (phases 0–5); the **artifact library** completed 2026-07-07 (durable
library + librarian + kind/runtime generalization + resource-aware eligibility + honest demos —
`docs/design/artifact-library.md`; only its crate-naming question stays open).
Research-track: the three-arm work-distribution experiment (Paper 1) and the monetary-
ecology article revision ([wiki](docs/wiki/domain/publications.md)). **Transparency-Platform
council-wiki substrate (2026-08-15):** five mechanism phases built + gated at MEETING scale
(`GitStore`, group-per-council, write gate, claim-check ingest, work distribution — exactly-once
gate); a same-day critique found six gaps before council scale (format codec, failover sync,
branch contention, batch commits, read plane, batch gate) — hardening plan
`docs/plans/council-substrate-hardening.md` (**Phase 6 complete M-side 2026-08-16**, incl. the
measured ten-council contention run; remaining items are FTT-side); design record
`docs/design/transparency-council-substrate.md`. Scale runs double as Paper 1.s case study. **mycelium-reason 0.6.0 (2026-09-04):** the NVIDIA-PAIR imports — router local reservations, the
OpenAI-compatible façade `/gateway/reason/v1/*`, the `llm_meta` vocabulary + `ollama` collector;
position: PAIR = GPU plane, Mycelium = agent plane, stackable (`docs/plans/mycelium-reason.md`
addendum). Core fix on the way: merged `with_http_routes` routers now sit behind gateway auth with
companion scope families. Delivery ledger:
[dev/history](docs/wiki/dev/history.md). Self-audit series: `docs/analysis/ratings.md`
(run via `/mycelium-analysis`).
