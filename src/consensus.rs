//! Consensus — epidemic two-phase agreement built on the signal mesh.
//!
//! Lightweight Group-level and System-level agreement built on top of the
//! epidemic signal layer. Uses a two-phase gossip voting protocol:
//!
//! ```text
//! Propose → (votes from group members) → Commit → KV committed/{slot}
//! ```
//!
//! Committed values are written to the Layer 1 KV store at
//! `consensus/committed/{slot}` and anti-entropy synced to late joiners.
//!
//! See [`GossipAgent::group_propose`] and [`GossipAgent::system_propose`] for
//! the entry points. [`GossipAgent::start_consensus_listener`] must be called
//! on every node that should participate as a voter.
//!
//! # Design notes
//!
//! - **Ballot numbering** (from SCP §6.2): monotonic counter stored at
//!   `consensus/ballot/{slot}`; higher ballot supersedes lower.
//! - **Group-scoped votes**: all group members see all votes; any member that
//!   reaches quorum may commit — proposer crash does not stall the slot.
//! - **No signing**: trusted-domain only; Byzantine fault tolerance is
//!   out of scope.
//! - **Quorum slices** (optional, SCP §3.1): nodes may declare trust sets via
//!   [`GossipAgent::declare_trust`]. The basic protocol uses simple majority;
//!   trust-slice-based quorum intersection is a future extension.
