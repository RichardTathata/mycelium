//! # Distributed lock service
//!
//! An ergonomic layer over [`ConsensusHandle::distributed_lock`](super::ConsensusHandle::distributed_lock):
//! **blocking acquire** (wait out contention instead of failing immediately), a **scoped
//! critical section** ([`with_lock`](LockService::with_lock)), and the guidance to use them
//! correctly. Every method returns the same consensus-backed [`LockGuard`] — mutually exclusive
//! cluster-wide, leased, with a monotonic fencing token — so a `LockService` lock and a raw
//! `distributed_lock` on the same *name* contend against each other (they share the
//! `lock/{name}` consensus slot).
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn ex(agent: std::sync::Arc<mycelium::GossipAgent>) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use std::time::Duration;
//! let locks = agent.consensus().locks();
//!
//! // Scoped critical section — acquire, run, release (the recommended form):
//! locks.with_lock("shard-7", Duration::from_secs(30), Duration::from_secs(10), |guard| {
//!     let fence = guard.token; // stamp resource writes with this (see the fencing-token note)
//!     async move {
//!         let _ = fence;
//!         // … exclusive work; the lock is released when this returns (or on panic/error) …
//!     }
//! }).await?;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Which lock primitive? (read this before choosing)
//!
//! | You want… | Use | Why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | **Exclusive access to a named resource**, willing to wait for it | [`LockService::lock`] / [`with_lock`](LockService::with_lock) | Blocks (bounded) until the lock is free; releases deterministically |
//! | **Best-effort try-lock** — take it now or move on | [`LockService::try_lock`] or [`distributed_lock`](super::ConsensusHandle::distributed_lock) | Immediate `Superseded` if held; no waiting |
//! | **Elect one leader / owner** for a group | [`elect_leader`](super::ConsensusHandle::elect_leader) | A lock whose *value* is the winner's id, read back by everyone |
//! | **Hand each *work item* to exactly one of many workers** | `mycelium-tuple-space` (`take`) | A lock serialises; a work queue *distributes*. Do **not** build a queue out of one lock |
//! | **One active consumer of an ordered log** (consumer group) | `KvHandle::subscribe_log_group` / the gateway | Leased single-active claim + private offset — the log-consumer pattern, not a mutex |
//! | **Agree a value under contention** (config, a decision) | [`consistent_set`](super::ConsensusHandle::consistent_set) | You want the agreed *value*, not exclusion |
//!
//! ## The leased-lock discipline (the one thing to get right)
//!
//! This is a **leased** lock: you hold it for `ttl`, then it **auto-expires** (the consensus
//! commit carries a lease). Expiry is the safety net — if a holder crashes or hangs, the lease
//! lapses and someone else can acquire, so the cluster never wedges on a dead holder. The
//! consequence, which you **must** design for (Kleppmann's fencing-token argument):
//!
//! > A leased lock cannot guarantee you *still* hold it at the moment you touch the resource — a
//! > GC pause or slow syscall can outlast your lease. **The fencing token is the real
//! > protection:** stamp every write to the protected resource with [`LockGuard::token`] (a
//! > per-name monotonically increasing token drawn from the **commit HLC** — not the consensus
//! > ballot, which can regress under gossip lag; see the #164 finding + the monotonicity test)
//! > and have the resource **reject a token lower than the highest it has seen.** Then a stale
//! > holder's late write is refused.
//!
//! Practically: pick `ttl` comfortably larger than your critical section, keep the section short,
//! and fence the resource. Coarse-grained by design — a consensus round per acquire (~1 s to let
//! the commit converge) — so this suits leader election, shard/config ownership, migrations; it
//! is **not** for high-rate fine-grained locking.
