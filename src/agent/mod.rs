// `TaskCtx::spawn_task` was removed in v2 M3 — `spawn_task` now lives on `CoreCtx`
// (the `task_handles` JoinSet it drives is a core field). `Arc<TaskCtx>` call sites
// Deref-coerce to it unchanged.

/// Core gossip agent.
///
/// All fields are private. Use the public methods to interact with the agent.
///
/// ## Interface patterns
///
/// ### Direct methods
/// Most methods (`set`, `get`, `emit`, `subscribe`, …) are synchronous or
/// `async fn`. They complete in the caller's task and return their result immediately.
///
/// ### Task helpers
/// A smaller subset of methods (`advertise`, `signal_once`, `watch`,
/// `manage_opacity`, `manage_opacity_gated`) spawn a background tokio task and return
/// a typed *handle* ([`AdvertiseHandle`](crate::signal::AdvertiseHandle),
/// [`WatchHandle`](crate::signal::WatchHandle),
/// [`OpacityHandle`](crate::signal::OpacityHandle), …). Dropping the handle cancels
/// the task; keeping it alive keeps the task running. These are for standing,
/// event-driven behaviours — periodic beacons, adaptive opacity controllers, reacting
/// to incoming signals — that must outlive a single `await` call without blocking the
/// caller.
///
/// All task-helper tasks exit automatically when [`shutdown`](Self::shutdown) is
/// called, even if the handle is still live.
///
/// ## Typed sub-handles
///
/// All domain operations are accessed through typed handles returned by the
/// accessor methods below. Each handle is `Clone + Send + Sync` and can be
/// stored, moved across tasks, or captured in closures.
///
/// | Accessor | Handle | Domain |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `agent.kv()` | [`KvHandle`] | KV store — Layer I |
/// | `agent.mesh()` | [`MeshHandle`] | Signal mesh — Layer II |
/// | `agent.consensus()` | [`ConsensusHandle`] | Consensus — Layer III |
/// | `agent.service()` | [`ServiceHandle`] | RPC / bulk / scatter / mailbox / sharding |
/// | `agent.capabilities()` | [`CapabilitiesHandle`] | Capability / requirement / wiring / demand |
/// | `agent.schemas()` | [`SchemaHandle`] | Schema registry |
/// | `agent.mcp()` | [`McpHandle`] | MCP tool bridge (server + client roles) |
/// | `agent.llm()` | [`LlmHandle`] | LLM prompt skills (`llm` feature) |
///
/// ## Lifecycle methods (directly on `GossipAgent`)
///
/// `new`, `with_http_routes`, `start`, `shutdown`, `shutdown_with_timeout`,
/// `node_id`, `peers`, `groups`, `signal_window`, `system_stats`, `is_ready`,
