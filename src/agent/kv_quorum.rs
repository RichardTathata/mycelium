//! Per-write ACK tracker for [`GossipAgent::set_with_min_acks`].
//!
//! `QuorumAckTracker` is installed by `set_with_min_acks` just before the write and
//! removed after the wait completes (success or timeout). It lives in
//! `KvState::quorum_trackers` keyed by the key string.  `apply_and_notify`
//! calls `observe` for every incoming update so each tracker learns when
//! distinct peers have confirmed the value.
//!
//! The tracker is per-write, not per-key: each key maps to a copy-on-write
//! *list* of trackers, so concurrent `set_with_min_acks` calls on the same
//! key coexist — every inbound update is observed by all of them, and each
//! caller removes exactly its own tracker (by `Arc` identity) on completion.
//! (A previous single-slot design let the second caller overwrite the first
//! tracker, and the first caller's unconditional cleanup then deleted the
//! second's — both callers could time out spuriously. M2 Run-18 sweep
//! finding.)
