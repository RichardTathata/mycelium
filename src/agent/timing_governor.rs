//! Cluster-wide live timing reconfiguration (WS-C / M10.2) — **intent-governed, fence-free**.
//!
//! M10.1 made the timing params (`health_check_interval_secs`, `reconnect_backoff_secs`)
//! hot-reloadable (the loops re-read [`HotConfig`] each cycle). This module distributes a change
//! *cluster-wide* the Mycelium way — **management = intent + local reconcile** (the same transport
//! the elastic governor uses, [`super::intent`]) — and **deliberately without a consensus fence**.
//!
//! ## Why no fence (the load-bearing decision)
//!
//! The ROADMAP's original M10 proposed a consensus fence (agree a config version, drain, restart,
//! confirm cluster-wide-atomic-or-rollback). Examined against the shipped substrate, the fence is
//! unnecessary — and importing it would violate Core Principle 1 (no coordinator):
//!
//! 1. **Within a node, apply atomically.** A [`TimingIntent`] carries the whole timing set and is
//!    applied in one reconcile pass, so no loop ever observes a half-applied config — closing the
//!    only *correctness* hazard the ROADMAP names.
//! 2. **Across nodes, transient variation is benign.** Mycelium is eventually-consistent and
//!    self-healing by design. A window where some nodes run the old `health_check_interval` and some
//!    the new is a *transient suboptimality* (slightly different detection latency), **not** a safety
//!    violation — no split-brain, no data loss; the cluster converges as each node reconciles. Paying
//!    for a coordinator to prevent a state the substrate already tolerates and heals is the
//!    coordinator trap.
//!
//! So the *end* (live cluster-wide timing reconfiguration) is delivered; the consensus *means* is
//! consciously declined. Newest-wins, **local-wins** (a node-local `set_*` pins the node — it is
//! sovereign over its own config), **evaporating** (TTL → self-heal to the static baseline). Human
//! and agent publishers are substrate-identical — intent, never command.
