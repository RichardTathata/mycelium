# The CI flake tier (Run-38 floor fix — docs/wiki/dev/testing/testing.md §The CI flake tier).
#
# Socket-binding / multi-node test suites are timing-sensitive by nature; before this tier a
# single wall-clock flake redded main (2026-07-07: a wiki `AddrInUse` port race), and the
# reactive alternative — widening timeouts — is exactly how a Major liveness bug hid for ten
# analysis runs (Run 37's lesson). This wrapper is the structural compromise:
#
#   * run the suite once; all green → done.
#   * on failure, re-run ONLY the failed tests, individually, once.
#       - rerun fails      → REAL failure → exit 1 (a deterministic bug always reds the build:
#                            it fails twice).
#       - rerun passes     → the build stays green BUT the flake is loudly recorded — a GitHub
#                            warning annotation + step-summary line per test. A flake is a bug
#                            report with visibility, never noise: recurring annotations must get
#                            a root-cause issue, not a timeout widen.
#   * compile errors / suite-level failures with no parseable test list → exit 1 unchanged.
#
# Deterministic unit gates should stay on bare `cargo test`; route only the port-binding suites
# through this tier.
#
# STRICT MODE (`CI_RETEST_STRICT=1`): the retry still runs, and the annotation is still written,
# but a pass-on-retry is a FAILURE. For the gates that carry a security or correctness claim —
# the audit chain and both gateway enforcement points — "eventually green" is not the same as
# deterministic, and an intermittent correctness failure would otherwise pass on the second try
# (external review, 2026-09-26). The isolated rerun is kept because it is diagnostic: it tells
# the reader whether the failure is order-dependent.
