# The Coordinator Trap — epistemic necessity, not performance

↑ [theory](theory.md)

**The core claim:** any coordinator must model the resource state of every agent it
coordinates and keep that model current. In a heterogeneous fleet whose capabilities, load,
and state change continuously, no coordinator can have sufficient local knowledge — it is
not just slower; it is *structurally incapable*. This is Holland's emergent-coordination
argument and Hayek's dispersed-knowledge argument arriving at the same place.

**Lineage (get the order right):** Mycelium started from John Holland's *Signals and
Boundaries* (2012) — the signal mesh, receptor routing, emergent groups, and the
capability/wiring subsystem are direct implementations of his CAS building blocks. Hayek
(*The Use of Knowledge in Society*, 1945) was discovered later as a complementary epistemic
framing; two independent traditions converging strengthens the claim. Paper 1 documents the
three structural failure modes of coordinator frameworks (unbounded audit obligation,
context loss on restart, output-format mismatch) as irreducible-by-improvement.

**Where the claim is strongest:** the gossip substrate + receptor routing (tight
derivation; alternatives demonstrably wrong for the use case) and the capability/wiring/
demand subsystem (most novel; no standard prior art). **Where qualified:** the consensus
layer — Raft is also *correct*, just not optimal under the embedded/decentralised
constraint; a design choice, not a unique derivation. Post-review moderation discipline
(see [publications](../publications.md)): the cross-domain convergence is *homologous*
evidence, not proof.

**Consensus is a protocol, never a service** (decided 2026-10-10, post-360 plan D1). The trap applies
to agreement as much as to scheduling: a fixed tier of nodes everyone must reach in order to agree
(the etcd or ZooKeeper shape) is a designed-in coordinator, so no deployment shape may make a named
node set the place agreement happens. Layer III's protocol is run by whichever nodes are in a group,
and the electorate for a safety-sensitive decision is a fixed set for that decision — named as a
group, kept apart from discovery, which stays dynamic. Canon: [`philosophy.md`](../../../philosophy.md)
§ *The corrected litmus* (*A protocol, not a service*); the decision record
[`design/consensus-electorate.md`](../../../design/consensus-electorate.md); the code-level residual is
on [runtime-invariants](../../dev/architecture/runtime-invariants.md).

**As a moat:** the published corpus is prior art — any competitor either cites it or
consciously diverges; either way Mycelium is the reference point. Competitor paths all
favour the incumbent: copying the model concedes the design; using a broker hits the
epistemic ceiling empirically; claiming narrower scope concedes the market. Compounds with
the SOC 2 process-time moat ([strategy](../strategy/licensing-and-compliance.md)). When
positioning: lead with the epistemic argument — performance is measurable and can be
competed away; epistemic impossibility cannot.
