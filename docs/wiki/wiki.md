# Mycelium — wiki root

The project's LLM Wiki (schema: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) — read it before editing; **code is
canon, the wiki cites it**). Start here, follow links down.

Mycelium is an embedded, broker-less Rust library: a three-layer substrate (gossip KV /
signal mesh / epidemic consensus) for AI agent fleets and storage replication, built on the
thesis that a coordinator is not just slower but *epistemically incapable* for heterogeneous
fleets. Purpose anchor: `docs/philosophy.md`. Version state: **v2.4.0 released** (2026-08-16, tag
`v2.4.0`) — the **wiki-substrate** MINOR: the git-as-truth `GitStore` (feature `git-store`; six-phase
hardening with recorded measurements — 330 ms/600-page reads, 5.5/3.0 batches/s ten-council
contention), the `GitMirror` projection sink (`git-mirror`), the claim-check **bulk-ingest** stack
(`BatchSource`/`apply_batch`/`submit_batch` + `POST /gateway/wiki/ingest` + py/ts SDK verbs), the
pluggable `PageFormat` codec, and curator failover over node-local stores (`refresh`/`publish`) —
all additive, wire unchanged; records
[`design/wiki-git-store.md`](../design/wiki-git-store.md) ·
[`design/transparency-council-substrate.md`](../design/transparency-council-substrate.md) ·
[`plans/council-substrate-hardening.md`](../plans/council-substrate-hardening.md). Also the first
tagged release carrying the wasmtime RUSTSEC-2026-0222 fix (the v2.3.0 tag predates it). Prior:
**v2.3.0** (2026-07-24) — the **SOC 2 audit-gap** MINOR: gateway TLS, audit export + retention checkpointing,
`sys/identity` authentication (CA anchor → signed `sys/identity-proof/` → `require_identity_proofs`,
default-off), rotate+revoke, and GDPR crypto-shred (`SubjectKeyRegistry`) — all additive, wire
unchanged; identity design [`design/identity-authentication.md`](../design/identity-authentication.md),
the adopter control map [`operations/shared-responsibility-matrix.md`](../../operations/shared-responsibility-matrix.md),
plan [`plans/soc2-audit-gap-closure.md`](../../plans/soc2-audit-gap-closure.md). Prior: **v2.2.0**
(2026-07-16) — a hardening MINOR (five-pass adversarial self-audit, input-fuzz gate,
identity-authentication Phase 1a, `/ready` fix). **v2.1.0** (2026-07-15) — `LockService`, CI-gated Docker suites, the #164
distributed-lock fixes; **v2.0.0** (all 16 milestones, 2026-06-21, + the v1.x production-readiness
workstreams). Wire **v12** (PREV 11) — unchanged since v2.0.0, a backwards-compatible rolling
upgrade. See [dev/history](dev/history.md) for the ledger.

## Sections

- **[dev/](dev/dev.md)** — how the substrate is built and verified: [architecture
  invariants](dev/architecture/architecture.md), [concurrency
  discipline](dev/concurrency/concurrency.md), [testing & scale
  lore](dev/testing/testing.md), [security workstreams](dev/security.md), [companion
  crates](dev/companions/companions.md), [operational surface](dev/operations.md),
  [example suites](dev/examples.md), [delivery history](dev/history.md).
- **[domain/](domain/domain.md)** — the coordinator-free thesis and its world:
  [theory](domain/theory/theory.md) (Coordinator Trap, scale-invariant boundaries,
  management-as-intent), [publications corpus](domain/publications.md) (4 papers, all
  published), [commercial strategy](domain/strategy/strategy.md).
