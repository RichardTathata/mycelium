# dev/ — how the substrate is built and verified

↑ [wiki root](../wiki.md) · schema: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)

System knowledge only (routing test → *no*: about our code, tests, infra). Code is canon —
pages here cite `src/` / `mycelium-core/src/` rather than paraphrasing it.

## Areas

- **[architecture/](architecture/architecture.md)** — the three layers, the crate split,
  runtime invariants that keep recurring in review.
- **[concurrency/](concurrency/concurrency.md)** — the lock-order table, lock-free (papaya)
  mutation rules, atomics ordering policy. The discipline that the calibration ledger shows
  is this codebase's recurring bug family.
- **[testing/](testing/testing.md)** — test conventions, the feature matrix, the CI-gated
  Docker cluster suites (+ their self-diagnosing harness), scale-test + Docker-bridge lore,
  the SWIM divergence saga.
- **[companions/](companions/companions.md)** — the companion crates built on the public API
  (tuple-space, blackboard, wasm-host, agentfacts).

## Leaf pages

- **[security.md](security.md)** — the v1.x WS1–WS5 security surface + crown-jewel posture.
- **[diagnostics.md](diagnostics.md)** — the emergent-detector layer (Legible Emergence, Phases
  1–5, complete): the five coordinator-free detectors + the three-verb operator spine —
  **localize** (`/gateway/fleet`) · **explain** (`/gateway/explain`) · **diagnose**
  (`/gateway/diagnose`), the `ViewConfidence` per-node-estimate posture, and the `/stats` +
  `/metrics` surface.
- **[operations.md](operations.md)** — diagnostics endpoints, task-count reference, feature
  gates, the ops label.
- **[examples.md](examples.md)** — the coop suite, AFN pipeline, A2A community demos; the by-layer
  map and the browser-showcase set.
- **[ui-example-contract.md](ui-example-contract.md)** — what every browser (UI) example must do:
  gateway+metrics features, Ops Console linking, opt-in audit, and the "what you're seeing" concepts box.
- **[history.md](history.md)** — the delivery ledger: v1.x + v2.0 workstreams, PR ranges,
  what was declined-with-evidence.

## Planned V3 runtime authorisation and evidence

The project owner adopted the AE slice on 2026-09-12, **plan rev 1.9, not implemented**.
See [the plan of record §6.8](../../plans/v3-contracts-axis.md#68-the-ae-slice--runtime-authorisation-and-evidence-rev-19)
and [ROADMAP](../../../ROADMAP.md). It composes receipts, caller identity, resource fences,
allocated rights and replay; policy evaluation is replaceable and no new central control service
is introduced. Local CI uses a stub consumer; the separately required joint pack runs both
scenarios on AWS/GCP with Mycelium participants and NovusLens evidence views.
**Rev 1.10 (2026-09-13)** pulls a thin slice (**AE-T**) forward to Phase B: caller identity on the
`tools/call` / `/a2a` paths, an evaluator + one in-process Cedar adapter at the gateway, a signed
`AuditSink` exporter, scenario 2 locally. Guarantee stated as a route-level preflight. *The wedge is
the gateway, not the fleet* — plan §1.5.
