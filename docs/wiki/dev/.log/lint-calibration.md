# wiki-lint calibration ledger (the miss-log)

The framework's own report card: every drift a **prior** lint pass declared clean — or a **scope
gap** that let drift persist unnoticed — recorded with what should have caught it and the sharpening
that resulted. This is to `wiki-lint` what the calibration ledger in `ratings.md` is to
`mycelium-analysis`: it measures whether "clean" verdicts predict reality, and it is what turns a
lint from a checklist into an audit.

**Review it before every lint** (a check with repeated misses in one area needs a *structural* fix,
not another point patch). **Append to it after** every pass — or every time drift surfaces
elsewhere (analysis, doc-coverage, a code review, a support question) — that a prior lint should
have caught.

Entry format:
`- {date}: {check} declared {area} clean [prior pass] but {drift} was live (found by {what}). Sharpening: {change}.`

## Misses

- 2026-07-02: **lock-order table** declared complete, but a `parking_lot::Mutex<VecDeque>` wrapped in
  a `type SenderLog` alias (`signal.rs:134`) was undeclared — even the Run-28-extended table missed it
  (found by the 2026-07-02 lint). Sharpening: added the lock-wrapping-type-alias grep
  (`^type|^pub type … | grep -i mutex|rwlock`) to §1.
- 2026-07-02: **lock-order table** — an undeclared lock site shipped while analysis scored Concurrency
  8–9 (found by analysis Run 28; `ratings.md` ledger 2026-07-02). Sharpening: the per-field-name diff
  + the table's explicit completeness claim ("add a row per new lock field").
- 2026-07-07: **KV-namespace table** — `src/lib.rs`'s table (and the front-door reserved list, which
  only ever diffed against *it*, not code) was missing **nine** live prefixes (`svc/ log/ clog/ lock/
  prompts/ skills/ installable/ comp/ wiki/`) (found by the 2026-07-07 lint). Sharpening: grep the
  workspace for prefix *writers* and diff against the table; widened the lock-grep to `mycelium-*/src/`.
- 2026-07-07: **examples.md demo count** — the wiki carried "eleven coop demos" though the smoke had
  run twelve since 2026-07-03 (found by wiki-lint 8, "the first lint that counted"; `ratings.md`
  ledger 2026-07-07). Sharpening: count from the live source; never pin a count the wiki says it won't.
- 2026-07-11: **scope gap — guide-chapter version constants.** `09-security.md` cited wire **v10
  "(current)"** and framed the rolling window as **v10 ↔ v9** through many passes; §1's cited-constant
  check covered only the front-door docs (`building-on-mycelium`, `faq`), not guide *chapters* (found
  by `doc-coverage` run 2). Sharpening: §1 now greps every `docs/guide/*.md` chapter that pins
  `WIRE_VERSION`/`PREV_WIRE_VERSION` and diffs against `framing.rs`. **On its first exercise the
  sharpened check earned its keep** — it caught a *residual* `wire v10` in the `09-security.md`
  mermaid diagram (line 33) that `doc-coverage` run 2's prose fix had missed; fixed to v12.
- 2026-07-11: **scope gap — testing.md gate-list vs actual CI.** `dev/testing/testing.md` listed the
  *clippy* of `mycelium-core` tests (implying coverage) while the crate's whole suite was never *run*
  in CI (no `-p mycelium-core` test job); §1 spot-checked `operations.md` endpoints but never diffed
  `testing.md`'s CI-gate block against `.github/workflows` (found by the mixed-version compat work).
  Sharpening: §1 now diffs the `testing.md` CI-gate list against the workflow `run:` steps.
- 2026-07-13: **scope gap — §4 treated "the knowledge has a home" as "covered."** The earlier
  2026-07-13 lint declared coverage complete for `coordination-approaches.md` on the grounds that the
  doc *exists* (user-facing) — but never checked that the **wiki cites it**. A cross-cutting decision
  the three companions all embody was reachable from guide/operations/design docs yet invisible from
  the wiki's own companions synthesis, contradicting the wiki's "code is canon, the wiki cites it"
  contract (found by the 2nd 2026-07-13 lint). Sharpening: §4 now asks not just "does durable knowledge
  have a home?" but "does the **wiki** cite that home?" — a new authoritative `docs/design/` decision
  the wiki's subject matter embodies must be linked from the relevant wiki page/folder-note, not merely
  exist elsewhere. Folded into the skill's §4.
- 2026-07-14: **scope gap — `examples.md` audited by count, not by category.** The examples-page checks
  had focused on the pinned *coop demo count* (the 2026-07-07 "eleven"→"twelve" miss) and never
  verified the page enumerates every example **category**. So the whole **visual-showcase** category
  (`conway`, `conway-gpu`) was absent from `dev/examples.md` for many passes, and this session's four
  new `*_viz` showcases had no home either (found by this lint after the showcase examples were added).
  Sharpening: §4/§1 examples-page check now verifies **category completeness** — starter · coop · AFN ·
  a2a · integration · **visual-showcases** — a whole category missing is a coverage finding, not just a
  wrong count. Fixed: added the *Visual showcases* bullet to `examples.md`.
- 2026-07-15: **the by-category check's own list was incomplete — a hardcoded category set is the
  same bug one level up.** The 2026-07-14 sharpening pinned the category list to `starter · coop · AFN
  · a2a · integration · visual-showcases`, so lints 3–4 applied it and declared the enumeration
  complete while **three whole categories were absent** from `dev/examples.md`: **Guardrails**
  (`mycelium-guardrails/examples/`), **Reasoning / LangGraph** (`mycelium-reason/examples/` + the Rust
  reason nodes the FAQ now cites), and the **Wiki companion** (`mycelium-wiki/examples/wiki_chat.rs`) —
  plus the **Skills / community** cluster as its own category. Found by a **user question** ("no
  examples for viewing audit or guardrails?") that triggered a workspace-wide example sweep. Root cause
  is identical to the count-vs-category miss, just one level up: a *fixed enumeration* (of categories,
  as before of counts) drifts the moment the tree grows past it — every companion crate's `examples/`
  was outside the scope the audit ever swept. **Sharpening (structural):** the category set must be
  **derived from the tree**, not hardcoded — enumerate `find . -path '*/examples/*.rs'` across **all**
  crates (not just `examples/` + coop) and diff the resulting categories against the page. And the
  durable fix for the recurrence: `dev/examples.md` should **cite `examples/README.md` § The suites**
  (the front-door index, now workspace-complete) as the canonical list, so the wiki synthesizes rather
  than maintains a parallel enumeration that silently falls behind. Folded into §4. Fixed: added the
  four missing category bullets to `examples.md`.
- 2026-07-15: **README section renames broke inbound `#anchor` links silently — twice in one restructure.**
  The capability-matrix restructure renamed `examples/README.md` sections (`Start here`/`The suites`/`Find
  one by layer` → `The capability matrix`/`The worlds`, plus `#ops-console`, `#research-artifacts`). Two
  cross-repo links that pointed *into* the old headings broke: `ui-example-contract.md` → `#find-one-by-layer`
  (fixed inline during the matrix commit) and `docs/guide/09-security.md` → `#the-suites` (shipped in the
  matrix commit; caught by *this* lint's §3). §3's dead-link check historically swept **outbound** links
  from the front-door docs (faq/building-on) but never **inbound** `README.md#anchor` links from the guide
  and wiki, so a heading rename in a heavily-linked front-door doc broke them with no check watching.
  **Sharpening (structural):** §3 now sweeps **inbound anchor links** — `grep -rnoE
  "examples/README\.md#[a-z-]+"` (and the same for any front-door doc whose headings changed) across
  `docs/` + crate READMEs, and confirms each `#anchor` still matches a live heading. Folded into §3. Fixed:
  repointed `09-security.md` → `#ops-console`.
- 2026-07-15: **UI-contract check verified a *known list*, never reconciled against the full tree-derived
  grep — so `ops_console` sat unclassified.** The §4 UI-example-contract check enumerates browser examples
  as `grep -rl 'include_str!.*\.html' examples` and had been verifying the 9 showcases + naming 2
  exceptions (`conway-gpu`, `three_node_demo`). But `examples/ops_console.rs` also `include_str!`s an
  `.html` — it matched the grep every pass — and was neither in the compliant-9 nor the exception list: it
  was silently skipped because it "obviously isn't a showcase." That is the count-vs-category bug again in
  a new place — the check trusted a curated list instead of reconciling every grep hit. Found when
  `ops_console`'s move to its own directory (2026-07-15) made me re-run the raw enumeration. `ops_console`
  is legitimately an **exception** — it is the *console itself*, the consumer/observer of `ui/viz`, not a
  showcase that advertises it, so rules 2 & 4 don't apply. **Sharpening (structural):** the check now
  requires **classifying every `include_str! html` hit** as *compliant* or *documented-exception* — an
  unclassified hit is itself a finding. Folded into §4 + the contract doc's Lint section. Fixed: added
  `ops_console` to the exceptions in `ui-example-contract.md`.
- 2026-07-20: **CI-gate list check was applied optimistically — three of the eight block commands had
  no live `run:` line.** `testing.md`'s "the full CI gate (for reference) is:" block lists
  `cargo test --lib --features compliance` (WS1 RBAC/WS2 audit/WS4 OIDC/WS5 rotation — **never** in any
  workflow, main crate), `cargo test --lib --no-default-features --features gateway` (consensus-free
  embed — never in any workflow), and `cargo clippy -p mycelium-core --lib --tests` (exists only inside
  a ci.yml *comment* since 979f8d6, 2026-07-11). All three ARE in `make check`, so local green masked
  the gap — the exact make-check-vs-CI family ingested 2026-07-16. The 2026-07-11 sharpening (diff the
  block against workflow `run:` steps) existed through the 2026-07-13/14/15 passes yet none flagged it
  (found by the 2026-07-20 lint delegating the diff to a fresh-eyes sweep that string-matched every
  command). Sharpening: the diff must match each command's *distinguishing flag set* against live
  `run:` lines **and the scripts they invoke** (`ci-retest.sh` args count; a workflow comment does
  not; a similar step on a different crate — `-p mycelium-guardrails --features compliance` — does
  not). Escalated as a **CI gap (code bug)**, per the report-don't-paper-over rule, not patched into
  the page.
- 2026-07-20: **KV-namespace table check missed two live prefixes — the 2026-07-07 nine-prefix family
  recurring.** `facts/{node}/{field}` (agentfacts per-field CRDT, live since the companion shipped) and
  `manifest/…` (the `mesh_manifest::manifest_keys` public module) were absent from BOTH the `src/lib.rs`
  ownership table and the guide's reserved list through every pass since 2026-07-07 (found by the
  2026-07-20 lint's fresh-eyes workspace sweep). Root cause: the 2026-07-07 sharpening greps
  `format!("…/` writer literals — but agentfacts writes through a helper built on a `FACTS_PREFIX`
  constant, and `manifest/` is defined as a public keys module whose writers are *application* code
  (the shipped example), so neither surfaced as a raw key literal. Sharpening: the sweep must also
  grep prefix **constants** (`grep -rnE '(PREFIX|_NS)[: ].*&str.*"[a-z-]+/"'`) and public `*_keys`
  modules across all crates — a namespace is reserved by its *definition*, not only by an in-crate
  writer. Fixed: both rows added to `src/lib.rs` + the guide; `sys/health` / `sys/rate` / `sys/role`
  subkey rows added while there.
- 2026-07-26: **scope gap — §1 front-door check never verified the install/dependency snippet resolves
  to *this* crate.** `building-on-mycelium.md` §1 told adopters `mycelium = "2"` / `mycelium-core = "2"`
  — crates.io *version* deps that resolve against an **unrelated, dormant 2019 project** of the same
  name (`gitlab.com/matthew.bradford/myceliumdds`, 0.1.1), not this crate; a fresh `cargo add mycelium`
  pulls the wrong code or fails. §1's front-door check verified `WIRE_VERSION`, the 8 sub-handles, the
  feature flags, and the reserved-prefix list — but never that the **dependency line itself points at
  this project** — so it declared the doc clean through every pass. Found by a user question about
  publishing v2.3 to crates.io, which surfaced the name collision. Root cause is the same family as the
  KV-namespace "reserved by *definition*, not by writer" miss (2026-07-20): a documented *fact about the
  outside world* the check never cross-verified against reality. **Sharpening:** §1's front-door check
  now verifies any dependency/install snippet — a bare crates.io `name = "x"` dep for a crate name this
  project does not own on crates.io is a finding; the supported form is the `git =`/`tag =` dep. Fixed:
  building-on §1 rewritten to git-tag deps + a why-not-crates.io note (commit 4ecc1aa); the constraint
  now has a wiki home on `companions.md` + `history.md` (2026-07-26).
- 2026-09-04: **§1 watch-RMW sweep — a "known false positive" note that covered one shape hid two
  others.** The 2026-07-21 first run recorded "one known false-positive shape (receiver-borrow relay,
  `capability_handle.rs`)" and every later pass (07-24, 07-26, 08-16) reported the sweep clean "in the
  delta" — but the file has *three* hits, and two are the *sender*-borrow compare-then-send shape
  (`*tx.borrow() == next` → `tx.send(next)`) the rule is literally about. Not a bug (the value is
  independent of the read), but never classified. Sharpening: the sweep classifies *every* hit by
  shape, in the log, each pass — "clean in the delta" is not a classification; and compare-then-send
  is written as `send_if_modified` (done for `watch_wiring`/`watch_demand`) so hits are zero, not
  "known".
- 2026-09-04: **§1 KV-namespace table — third miss.** `audit/{ts}/{node}` (SkillRunner's plain audit
  trail, `src/bin/skillrunner/audit.rs`, the `not(compliance)` path) was absent from `src/lib.rs` and
  the guide through every pass since 2026-07-07 although it is a raw `format!("audit/…")` writer the
  2026-07-07 sharpening's grep matches — under `src/bin/`, which the sweeps' `src/` glob covers but
  no pass ever *listed* the `src/bin` hits separately, so the skillrunner writer was skimmed past as
  "the compliance audit row". Also: `building-on` keeps the reserved prefixes in **two** forms (a
  table-ish list at §KV keys and a bullet in the copy-paste block); the 2026-07-20 fix updated one.
  Sharpening: the front-door check diffs *every* occurrence of the reserved list (grep the prefix
  set, not the first match); the namespace sweep prints hits grouped by crate incl. `src/bin`.
- 2026-09-04: **§3 dead-link sweep declared `wiki.md` clean with two dead links in it** (added
  2026-07-24 with one `../` too many; passes 07-24, 07-26, 08-16 all reported "dead links: none").
  The prior sweeps resolved links from section pages; the front door itself was either skipped or
  resolved relative to `docs/` rather than the file. Sharpening: the sweep script resolves every link
  relative to *its own file's directory* and includes `wiki.md` and the front-door guide docs in the
  same pass (this pass's script does; keep it — it is in the log).
- 2026-09-05: **§1 front-door reserved-prefix list — "two lists, one updated", third time.** The
  2026-09-04 pass fixed `audit/` into `building-on`'s *bullet* form (line ~142) and declared both forms
  reconciled, but the *blockquote* form (line ~72, the one adopters read first) still lacked `audit/`
  (found by this pass diffing the `src/lib.rs` prefix set against **each** occurrence separately). The
  2026-09-04 sharpening said "diff every occurrence" but was applied by eye. Sharpening (mechanical):
  extract the lib.rs set (`grep -oE '^//! \| \`[a-z_-]+/' src/lib.rs`), then for each list occurrence in
  `building-on` (`grep -n 'grp/' docs/guide/building-on-mycelium.md` finds them all) print the prefixes
  the lib.rs set has that the occurrence lacks — a non-empty diff on *any* occurrence is the finding.
  Companion prefixes may live in the blockquote's second paragraph ("Companion claims"); core ones must
  be in the first. Fixed: `audit/` added to the blockquote.
- 2026-09-05: **§3 dead-link sweep — scope gap: guide chapters outside the two front-door docs.** The
  same-day lint declared "0 dead, 0 orphans" over `docs/wiki/**` + `faq` + `building-on`, but
  `docs/guide/cookbook.md` carried `README.md#which-crate--mycelium-vs-mycelium-core` pointing at
  `docs/guide/README.md` (no such heading — it lives in the repo-root `README.md`) since the 2026-07-13
  anchor-checker commit. Found by doc-coverage run 16's link check over the pages it touched.
  Sharpening: §3's script sweeps **every** `docs/guide/*.md` and `docs/operations/*.md` (not only the
  wiki + two front doors), with anchor resolution, each pass — the guide is where cross-links break.
