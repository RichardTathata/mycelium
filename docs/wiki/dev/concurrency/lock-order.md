# Lock-order table

↑ [concurrency](concurrency.md) · sibling: [lock-free-and-atomics](lock-free-and-atomics.md)

All `Mutex` and `RwLock` sites in the codebase. **Invariant: no function acquires more than
one lock from this table** — flat acquisitions only, so no ordering discipline is needed
beyond this list.

**Keep this table honest:** it claims completeness — when adding any `Mutex`/`RwLock` field,
add a row. Analysis Run 28 found rows 9–14 missing after three feature waves; the flat
invariant held, but only by luck of review. The doc-vs-code lint (schema §Lint) greps for
`Mutex<`/`RwLock<` declarations and diffs against this table.

| # | Field | Type | Acquired in | Notes |
|---|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | `CoreCtx::task_handles` | `Mutex<JoinSet>` | `spawn_task()`, `wait_for_tasks()`, shutdown drain | Short-lived; the shutdown drain swaps the set out before awaiting |
| 2 | `TaskCtx::rpc_pending` | `Mutex<HashMap>` | `rpc_call_ctx`, `rpc.result` handler | Poison-recovering; never across `await` |
| 3 | `CoreCtx::reorder_buf` | `Mutex<ReorderBuffer>` | `emit_ordered()`, flush task | Lock+flush synchronous |
| 4 | `CoreCtx::signal_boundary` | `parking_lot::RwLock<Boundary>` | read: every `emit()`; write: join/leave/suppress | `read()` is the hot path |
| 5 | `GossipAgent::gossip_rxs` | `Mutex<Option<Vec<Receiver>>>` | `start()` (`take()`d once) | Single-use |
| 6 | `GossipAgent::extra_routes` | `Mutex<Option<Router>>` | `with_http_routes()`, `start()` | Gateway feature; single-use |
| 7 | `KvStore::index_stripes` | `[Mutex<()>; 64]` | `apply_and_notify` index reconcile | Leaf lock; exists because the store CAS is lock-free (M2 Run-18 finding: index ops could interleave opposite to CAS order and strand a key outside `scan_prefix`) |
| 8 | `TaskCtx::audit_chain` | `Mutex<AuditChainState>` (`compliance`) | `audit()` sealing | Guard released **before** the KV write; signing happens after the lock |
| 9 | `AgentStateMachine::current` | `parking_lot::Mutex<ExecutionState>` | `state()`, `try_commit()`, `force_failed_transition()` | The commit lock: validate-and-swap **plus** budget-counter check + reserve as one atomic step (Run 28 fix). Policy is snapshotted before acquiring — never take #10 while holding this |
| 10 | `AgentStateMachine::policy` | `parking_lot::RwLock<AgentPolicy>` | guards, snapshots, `set_policy()` | Read-mostly; never held while acquiring #9 |
| 11 | `AgentStateMachine::task_id` / `::timeout_handle` | `parking_lot::Mutex<…>` | task-id set/read; timeout arm/cancel | Leaf locks, single-statement |
| 12 | `SwimState::pending` | `Mutex<AHashMap<u64, oneshot::Sender>>` | probe register/resolve/forget | Leaf; poison-recovering |
| 13 | `SwimState::membership` | `Mutex<SwimMembership>` | `lock_membership()` callers | Leaf; never held while acquiring #12 |
| 14 | `FilterOpacityRegistry::entries` | `Mutex<Vec<RegEntry>>` | `declare_requirement`, opacity watcher | Leaf; poison-recovering |
| 15 | `HttpCtx::gateway_caps` | `Mutex<HashMap<String, oneshot::Sender>>` | gateway capability register/retract handlers | Leaf; poison-recovering; single-statement insert/remove |
| 16 | `HttpCtx::lock_guards` | `Mutex<HashMap<String, LockGuard>>` | gateway distributed-lock acquire/release handlers | Leaf; poison-recovering; single-statement insert/remove |
| 17 | `OidcVerifier::cache` | **`tokio::sync::RwLock<Option<CachedKeys>>`** | JWT verify (read), JWKS refresh (write) | **The one sanctioned async lock**: the write guard is *deliberately held across the JWKS HTTP fetch* so refresh is single-flight (readers on the hot path take a cheap read-lock on cached keys). Do not copy this pattern without the same single-flight justification |
| 18 | `SignalLog::sender_log` values | `PapayaMap<Arc<str>, Arc<parking_lot::Mutex<VecDeque<(NodeId, Instant)>>>>` | `record()`, `quorum()`, sender-history reads (`mycelium-core/src/signal.rs`) | Per-kind leaf locks *inside* a papaya map (hidden behind the `SenderLog` type alias): arc retrieved via retry-safe `compute`, then locked for a short synchronous prune/push or scan. Never across `await` |
| 19 | `EventRing::events` | `std::sync::Mutex<VecDeque<Event>>` | `record()`, `since()` (Legible-Emergence Phase 3, `src/agent/emergent.rs`) | Leaf lock: bounded event ring; short synchronous push-and-drop-oldest or filter-and-clone scan, never across `await` |
| 20 | `MeshArtifactSource::cache` | `std::sync::Mutex<HashMap<ArtifactId, Bytes>>` | `prefetch()` (contains/insert), `fetch()` (get) (`mycelium-wasm-host/src/mesh_source.rs`) | Leaf; single-statement ops; released before the `pull_artifact` await inside `prefetch` (added retroactively — pre-dated this row, found in the artifact-library session 2026-07-07) |
| 21 | `Provisioner::hosted` | `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<ArtifactId, HostedState>>>` | `provision_round` passes (`is_hosted`), `start_install` reservation, install-task completion swap, `withdraw`, counts, `reserved_requirements` (resource eligibility, §4.4) (`mycelium-wasm-host/src/provisioner.rs`) | Leaf; acquired once per function, never across `await`; install tasks lock once at completion (token-checked swap), teardown of a superseded install runs *outside* the lock |
| 22 | install-task loading tier (local) | `Arc<Mutex<(u64, Option<CapabilityReg>)>>` | the `ProgressFn` closure + post-install drop in `start_install`'s spawned task (`mycelium-wasm-host/src/provisioner.rs`) | Leaf, task-local (not a struct field); callback runs on the runtime's pull thread (`spawn_blocking`) — sync only, never across `await`; guards the last-pct step + the `{ns}/loading` advertisement handle |
| 23 | `PrefetchingSource::cache` | `std::sync::Mutex<HashMap<ArtifactId, Bytes>>` | `prefetch()`/`prefetch_all()` (contains/insert), `fetch()` (get) (`mycelium-wasm-host/src/http_source.rs`) | Leaf; single-statement ops; released before the `fetch_remote` await inside `prefetch` — same shape as row 20 |
| 24 | `TupleStore::inner` (per-stage `StageInner`) / `::queue_waits_us` / `::inflight` | `parking_lot::Mutex<…>` | take/complete/requeue/sweep + latency sampling (`mycelium-tuple-space/src/store.rs`) | Store-internal leaves, sync methods only. The per-stage `inner` is the exactly-once **claim** lock (single-owner take); `inflight` is the crash-requeue registry. Never held while acquiring another row |
| 25 | tuple-space `WalInner::inner` | `parking_lot::Mutex<WalInner>` | WAL append / checkpoint / replay (`mycelium-tuple-space/src/store.rs:993`) | Leaf; short synchronous file ops under the guard (the WAL is single-writer by construction) |
| 26 | `TupleSpace::{store, primary_reg, role_reg, replay_cursor, last_heartbeat_sender, mirror_stages, tasks}` | `parking_lot::Mutex<…>` (7 fields) | role election/failover, mirror replay, lifecycle (`mycelium-tuple-space/src/lib.rs`) | Handle-level leaves: single-statement or scoped-block guards, sequential (never nested). One nuance: `init_store` holds the `store` slot guard across store *construction* (WAL open/replay) — the freshly-built row-24/25 locks are unshared until published, so no ordering hazard. `shutdown` drains `tasks` as its own statement |
| 27 | `BoardStore::inner` | `parking_lot::Mutex<BoardInner>` | post/claim/ack/sweep (`mycelium-blackboard/src/store.rs:62`) | Store-internal leaf, sync methods only — the blackboard's single-owner claim lock (same exactly-once shape as row 24) |
| 28 | blackboard `WalInner::inner` | `parking_lot::Mutex<WalInner>` | WAL append / checkpoint (`mycelium-blackboard/src/wal.rs:125`) | Leaf; same single-writer discipline as row 25 |
| 29 | `Blackboard::{store, primary_reg, role_reg, mirrored, tasks}` | `parking_lot::Mutex<…>` (5 fields) | role election/failover, mirror dedup, lifecycle (`mycelium-blackboard/src/lib.rs`) | Handle-level leaves, same shape (and the same `init_store` construction nuance) as row 26 |
| 30 | `Wiki::{last_lint, curator_reg, candidate_reg, tasks, curator_tasks}` | `parking_lot::Mutex<…>` (5 fields) | election, step-down sentinel, curatorship start/stop, `shutdown` (`mycelium-wiki/src/agent.rs`) | Leaves: sequential temporaries, never nested (`shutdown` drains `tasks` then `curator_tasks` as separate statements; step-down swaps `curator_reg`/`candidate_reg` one statement each). `curator_tasks` is separate from `tasks` precisely so the sentinel can stop *only* the curatorship's loops (#127) |
| 31 | `SubjectKeyRegistry::keys` | `std::sync::Mutex<HashMap<String,[u8;32]>>` | crypto-shred erasure encrypt/decrypt/destroy (`mycelium-core/src/erasure.rs`, `tls` feature — SOC 2 WS-F) | Self-contained leaf: the per-subject DEK map. Every method (`encrypt_for`/`decrypt_for`/`destroy`/`get_or_create`) takes the guard, does a single map op (+ synchronous AEAD outside or inside the short hold), and releases — never nested, no `await` under the guard (all methods are sync) |
| 32 | `GitStore::write_lock` | `std::sync::Mutex<()>` | every write path (`write_with`/`write_pages`/`refresh`/`publish`, `mycelium-wiki/src/git_store.rs`) | Leaf; held across local git subprocess I/O **by design** (documented in the struct — the store's writer is a single curator; the atomic `update-ref` CAS is the cross-instance backstop). **Flatness restored by the 2026-08-16 lint:** `write_with`'s current-state read briefly nested `cat_file` under this lock — retargeted to a spawn-based read (`load_at_spawned`) so no function holds both |
| 33 | `GitStore::cat_file` | `std::sync::Mutex<Option<CatFile>>` | `read_blob` (every read-path blob fetch — the P6.2 persistent `cat-file --batch` child) | Leaf; held for one pipe round-trip (µs–ms), sync only. Never taken while `write_lock` is held (row 32's note) |
| 34 | `GitMirror::busy` | `parking_lot::Mutex<()>` | `round_applied` (`mycelium-wiki/src/sink.rs`) | Leaf, **`try_lock`-and-skip only** — a contended mirror pass is skipped (snapshots are idempotent; the next round heals), so this lock never blocks any caller |
| 35 | `FsStore::mutate` | `std::sync::Mutex<()>` | every mutator (`write_section`/`update_manifest`/`write_page`/`remove_page`, `mycelium-wiki/src/fs.rs`) | Leaf, sync fs I/O only, never nested. Added 2026-09-02 (360-review): per-object CAS resolves write-write races, but `remove_page` deletes *many* objects and must not interleave with a write recreating the page mid-erasure (manifest surviving with its sections deleted). In-process only — across processes the CAS versioning is the (weaker) backstop and erasure stays idempotent |

**Scope: the full workspace** (extended 2026-07-07 on review — rows 24–30 inventory the
data-plane companions; previously the table silently covered only `mycelium-core` +
`mycelium`, and the lint's grep matched that blind spot). Every companion lock is a
`parking_lot` **leaf** — the flat invariant holds workspace-wide. `mycelium-agentfacts`
holds no locks.

**Async contexts:** guards from every *sync* lock above are `!Send` across `await`
(`std::sync` and default `parking_lot` alike) — the compiler enforces it for spawned
futures; all those sites release before any `await`. `std::sync::Mutex` is the default
flavour; `signal_boundary` (row 4) and `AgentStateMachine` (rows 9–11) use `parking_lot`
with the same discipline. `tokio::sync` locks are banned **except** row 17's documented
single-flight exception.
