# dev/history — the delivery ledger

↑ [dev/](dev.md) · full execution records: `docs/plans/README.md` (the canonical index)

Reconciled current state of *what shipped when* — so no session re-derives it from git.
As of 2026-06-21 all v1.x/v2.0 engineering plans were shipped. Since then, **Legible Emergence
(diagnosability) is COMPLETE — all phases 0–5 shipped** (2026-07-02/03; see
[diagnostics.md](diagnostics.md) and `docs/plans/legible-emergence.md`):

- **Phase 0** — the pathology taxonomy design record (RT1–RT4 red-team baked in).
- **Phase 1** — the five coordinator-free emergent detectors + `/stats`/`/metrics`.
- **Phase 2** — `GET /gateway/fleet`, the relational fleet snapshot (throttle graph, cross-node
  store-convergence, commit-conflict hot slots).
- **Phase 3** — the HLC-stamped `EventRing` + `GET /gateway/explain`, cross-node causal
  reconstruction (best-effort fan-out naming non-responders; the #56 narrative).
- **Phase 4** — `GET /gateway/diagnose`, the `diagnose_fleet` rule engine (the "why is the fleet
  in this state" narrative, one rule per pathology).
- **Phase 5** — the operator surface: public `fleet_snapshot()`/`fleet_diagnosis()` API,
  `docs/operations/diagnostics.md` runbook + Prometheus alert recipes, guide pattern 11, and the
  coop `diagnostics` demo (induce-and-diagnose, Docker-free in CI).

The three-verb operator spine — **localize** (`/fleet`) · **explain** (`/explain`) · **diagnose**
(`/diagnose`) — is shipped, tested, and documented for both audiences.

## v2.4.3 release — 2026-09-05 (tag `v2.4.3`)

A **durability PATCH** cut the same day as v2.4.2 (wire **v12**/PREV 11 unchanged; on-disk format
unchanged; no `mycelium` API change). Why: the v2.4.2 snapshot merge's WAL read-back used
`unwrap_or_default()` — a transient read error during a snapshot would have installed a snapshot *without*
the tail and then truncated it, a data-loss path one step past the race v2.4.2 fixed. Found by the
deterministic-replay design review's storage section ("schedule this failure explicitly"), confirmed and
fixed the same day (#181); the snapshot now aborts on read failure. Release gate: **CI-green on `a439f69`
and on the release PR before tagging**. Log `.log/2026-09-05-v2.4.3-release.md`. Also between the tags:

- **SDK gateway bearer + `persisted`** (2026-09-05, #178 / #179; tags `mycelium-py-v0.2.4`,
  `mycelium-ts-v0.1.1`): every handle takes `token=` / `{ token }` (fallback `MYCELIUM_GATEWAY_TOKEN`),
  riding pooled + SSE clients; `consistent_set` / `cross_group_propose` return `CommitResult { persisted }`.
  `jest` now CI-gated. Logs `.log/2026-09-05-sdk-bearer-token.md`.
- **ROADMAP v3.0 — scoped mandates recorded as proposed** (2026-09-05): the fourth external plan (seven
  PRs — mandate contract, CAS ≠ authorization, three lifecycle events, handover journal, incumbency rules);
  anchors verified; **one architectural reconciliation** (no new authority daemon — fence inside the store's
  own atomic boundary; establishment as a leased consensus slot; durable proposals via the log verb) + six
  more. Same log, addendum.
- **ROADMAP v3.0 — the knowledge layer recorded as proposed** (2026-09-05): the third external plan
  (`mycelium-knowledge`, seven PRs — claim/observation/assessment/acceptance records, evidence-aware
  resolution); anchors verified (trace lacks parent links; `knowledge/` unreserved); six PR-1
  reconciliations. Same log, addendum.
- **ROADMAP v3.0 — the contracts axis recorded as proposed** (2026-09-05): the third-party six-enhancement
  proposal + seven-PR contracts plan, our verification of its anchors (the `>=` quorum ack; no directory
  fsync), four PR-1 reconciliations, two ordering adjustments. `.log/2026-09-05-v3-contracts-axis.md`.

## v2.4.2 release — 2026-09-05 (tag `v2.4.2`)

A **security + durability PATCH** on the 2.4 line, cut the day after v2.4.1 from a single external
code review whose five findings were each reproduced by a probe before being fixed and each gated
by a regression test. Wire **v12**/PREV 11 unchanged; on-disk persistence format unchanged. **One API
note:** `ConsensusResult::Committed { persisted }` — additive, every in-tree matcher uses `{ .. }`,
but a downstream exhaustive destructure must add `..`. Release gate: **CI-green before tagging**
(the three merges #169 / #172 / #171 on `main`, then the release PR). Log
`.log/2026-09-05-v2.4.2-release.md`. What went in (the three PRs, merged in this order):

- **`langgraph-checkpoint-mycelium` 0.1.1** (2026-09-05, branch `fix/checkpointer-async-rows`):
  `alist` ran the sync row-selection driver on the event loop (finding 5 of the external
  review). Now a pure window/filter core + sync and async drivers, parity-gated without a node
  (`tests/test_alist_async.py`). Log `.log/2026-09-05-checkpointer-async-rows.md`.

- **Node-level routes behind gateway auth** (2026-09-05, branch
  `fix/public-routes-behind-gateway-auth`, stacked on the persistence fix): `/mcp`,
  `/signals/{kind}`, `/consensus/{slot}` answered without a bearer (finding 4 of the same
  external review) — `tools/call` with the node's identity. Now behind `gateway_auth` with
  `mcp:invoke` / `mesh:read` / `consensus:read`; `/bulk/{id}` stays a nonce-capability URL.
  Security PATCH material. Log `.log/2026-09-05-public-routes-behind-auth.md`.

- **Persistence durability — three P1 fixes** (2026-09-05, branch `fix/persistence-durability-p1`):
  an external review reproduced (1) a threshold snapshot erasing an acked, fsynced write (writer
  acks then snapshots in the same poll; callers applied after the ack), (2) replay filtering WAL
  records by HLC as if it were a log position, (3) `Ok` acks from a dead writer + `append_sync`
  not syncing outside `Flush` + consensus discarding the result. Fixed with apply-then-append at
  every write site, a WAL-tail LWW merge inside `do_snapshot`, LWW replay of every record,
  `BrokenPipe` acks, forced fsync, and `ConsensusResult::Committed { persisted }`. Invariants:
  [runtime-invariants §Persistence](architecture/runtime-invariants.md); log
  `.log/2026-09-05-persistence-durability-p1.md`.

## v2.4.1 release — 2026-09-04 (tag `v2.4.1`)

A **security PATCH** on the 2.4 line (wire **v12**/PREV 11 unchanged; no `mycelium` public-API
change — rolling upgrade holds). Release gate: **CI-green before tagging** (`65e0df6`). Why a
release: the v2.4.0 tag ships wasmtime 46.0.2 (RUSTSEC-2026-0269) and has every companion
`/gateway/…` surface open to unauthenticated callers when a gateway token is set. Cut from
CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`; the auth fix carries an upgrade note for scoped-token deployments
(companion scope families). What accumulated since v2.4.0:

- **Two 360° review passes over `v2.4.0..HEAD`** (2026-09-02/03): mycelium-py 0.2.1 → 0.2.3
  (pooling bugs, lifecycle unification, uncapped long-poll pool), `FsStore` erase-vs-write
  serialization (lock-order row 35), one ref-CAS retry driver in `GitStore`; two RUSTSEC bumps.
  Log: `.log/2026-09-02-360-review-fixes.md`.
- **The nightly runner read correctly** (2026-09-03): stale checkout for 17 days, TCC timing,
  FORWARD-chain ceiling — `.log/2026-09-03-nightly-stale-checkout-and-ceiling.md`.
- **`mycelium-reason` 0.6.0 — the PAIR imports** (2026-09-04, tag `mycelium-reason-v0.6.0`):
  router **local reservations** (row 36), the **OpenAI-compatible façade** `/gateway/reason/v1/*`,
  the **`llm_meta` vocabulary** + `ollama` collector + `ollama_serve`. **Core fix:** routers merged
  via `with_http_routes` had bypassed the gateway auth layer — prefix-guarded layer + companion
  **scope families** (`llm`/`wiki`/`board`/`tuple`). Position (plan addendum): PAIR = GPU plane,
  Mycelium = agent plane, stackable. Coherence assessment + log:
  `.log/2026-09-04-pair-imports.md`; ledger entry (Security 8 at Run 59) in `docs/analysis/ratings.md`.
- **Same day:** `openai_serve` (the stacking example, mock-engine runnable); analysis **Run 60**
  (floor 7/7/7 — Modularity/Configurability/Robustness; yanked `chacha20` fixed); a **wiki-lint**
  pass (8 findings incl. the compliance clippy CI gap and the `audit/` KV row; 3 ledger entries);
  advisories h2 0.4.16 (RUSTSEC-2026-0258) and wasmtime 46.0.3 (RUSTSEC-2026-0269) from the
  review days.

## v2.4.0 release — 2026-08-16 (tag `v2.4.0`)

The **wiki-substrate** MINOR since v2.3.0. Wire **v12** (PREV 11) unchanged — a fully
backwards-compatible rolling upgrade (rolling-upgrade + prev-wire gates green). Release gate:
**CI-green before tagging**. Cut from CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`. Highlights:

- **`GitStore`** (feature `git-store`) — the git-as-truth `WikiStore`, built strictly inside the
  E1–E4 eligibility envelope of `design/wiki-git-store.md` (first qualifying deployment: a
  public-record council-minutes corpus, `design/transparency-council-substrate.md`). Content-hash
  CAS tokens that never appear in the document; plumbing commits behind an atomic `update-ref`
  branch-head CAS; six-phase hardening with **recorded measurements** (reads: 330 ms/600 pages;
  contention: 5.5/3.0 batches/s over ten councils, zero spurious failures — the gate surfaced and
  fixed four real defects, incl. the merge-tree→subtree-splice falsification) — full trail:
  `plans/council-substrate-hardening.md`.
- **`GitMirror`** (feature `git-mirror`) — the git audit-projection `ChangeSink` for
  store-as-truth deployments: one reviewable commit per curated round, `EgressPolicy`-gated push,
  divergence tripwire, `rebuild()` as the erasure path. The keep-all decision (2026-08-16): both
  git shapes stay — the mirror is the general answer, the store the envelope exception.
- **Bulk ingest** — the claim-check stack: `IngestBatch`/`BatchSource`/`apply_batch` (batch-atomic
  through the write gate; byte-identical to a serial writer; resubmit is a no-op),
  `Wiki::submit_batch` RPC, and the boundary surface a consumer's-eye pass demanded:
  **`POST /gateway/wiki/ingest`** + `ingest` verbs on both SDKs. A batch = one meeting (the
  sizing contract).
- **Failover over node-local stores** — `WikiStore::refresh`/`publish` default methods;
  pull-on-promote (a curator that cannot refresh never serves), push-per-round, the ≤1-round
  un-published-tail residual tested rather than hidden.
- **`PageFormat`** — the pluggable entity codec (byte-exact round-trip; orphans-must-survive),
  proven end-to-end with a custom format; a deployment's own schema plugs in.
- **Exactly-once work distribution across companions** — tuple-space leases × idempotent ingest,
  with the kill at the worst point (after submit, before ack).
- **Security note:** the first tagged release carrying the **wasmtime RUSTSEC-2026-0222** fix
  (46.0.2) — the v2.3.0 tag was cut from a lineage predating the 2026-07-16 bump and ships 45.0.3
  with that low-severity advisory open.

Full notes: `CHANGELOG.md` § [2.4.0].

## v2.3.0 release — 2026-07-24 (tag `v2.3.0`)

Wire **v12** (PREV 11) unchanged — a fully backwards-compatible rolling upgrade; additive public API
throughout (minor bump). Also the **R1** step of the identity Phase-3 rollout: `require_identity_proofs`
ships default-off. The complete adopter-facing SOC 2 / pentest gap closure — plan
[`docs/plans/soc2-audit-gap-closure.md`](../../plans/soc2-audit-gap-closure.md) (✅ complete), all
CI-verified. Pure-library path; each workstream flips a
[shared-responsibility-matrix](../../operations/shared-responsibility-matrix.md) cell:

- **WS-A gateway TLS** — native server-side HTTPS (`GossipConfig::gateway_tls`) so bearer tokens
  aren't cleartext; hand-rolled `tokio-rustls`+`hyper-util` acceptor (no new compiled crate).
- **WS-B compromise remediation** — `rotate_identity_on_compromise` + `POST /gateway/identity/revoke`
  (`identity:write`); revocation was already consulted on all verify paths incl. consensus.
- **WS-C audit export** — pluggable `AuditSink` (SIEM/WORM) off the write path.
- **WS-D audit retention** — signed `AuditCheckpoint` (`sys/audit-checkpoint/`) → export → prune,
  verify-from-checkpoint.
- **WS-E `sys/identity` authentication** — the security-critical one: 1a extraction primitive · 1b
  CA-cert **anchor** harvest + `identity_anchor_conflicts` tripwire · 2 signed
  `sys/identity-proof/` (**prevention** — reject an overwrite not chained to a trusted key) · 3
  `require_identity_proofs` config flag (reject unsigned; **not** a wire bump — no frame change).
  Closes the forged-consensus-quorum vector. Full design
  [`design/identity-authentication.md`](../../design/identity-authentication.md).
- **WS-F GDPR erasure** — `SubjectKeyRegistry` crypto-shred (per-subject DEK; erase = destroy key),
  [`design/data-lifecycle-and-erasure.md`](../../design/data-lifecycle-and-erasure.md).
- **Process fix:** `make check` now clippies the `compliance` feature (it previously went un-linted
  locally — the local-vs-CI gap); three CI gates (compliance suite, consensus-free embed, core
  clippy) added. New direct deps `ring`/`hyper-util`/`tower-service` were all already in-tree.

## Companion re-versioning + distribution reality — 2026-07-26

Not a substrate release — a correction to two things that had drifted by neglect while the substrate
walked 2.1 → 2.3:

- **Re-versioned the two v3.0 companions by actual maturity, on independent version lines** (they
  compose the public `mycelium` 2.x API only — *not* the 2.x train): `mycelium-guardrails`
  **0.1.0 → 1.0.0** (tag `mycelium-guardrails-v1.0.0`) — an **API-stability commitment**; its scope is
  feature-complete, the remaining limits (promise-strength, eventually-consistent policy, coarse
  revocation) are **by-design** of a coordinator-free model, not gaps. `mycelium-reason`
  **0.1.0 → 0.5.0** (tag `mycelium-reason-v0.5.0`) — mature but deliberately **pre-freeze**: real-LLM
  backend / chunked-blob-past-8-MiB / conversation-memory / run-level-evals still open and may shape
  the API. No code change; per-crate CHANGELOGs added. **"v3.0" is a work epoch, not a version** — the
  substrate stays 2.x (ROADMAP v3.0 now says so explicitly).
- **Distribution is by git tag, not crates.io.** The `mycelium`/`mycelium-core` names on crates.io
  belong to an **unrelated, dormant 2019 project** (`gitlab.com/matthew.bradford/myceliumdds`, 0.1.1) —
  they are not this crate, and crates.io has no forced-transfer / abandoned-name reclaim path (only a
  voluntary owner handoff). So the supported install is git-tag deps (companions resolve the
  workspace-internal `mycelium` automatically); a `cargo add mycelium` would need the substrate
  **renamed** to a free name. This also fixed a latent bug: `building-on-mycelium.md` §1 had told
  adopters `mycelium = "2"`, which resolves against the 2019 crate. Install story:
  [`building-on-mycelium.md`](../../guide/building-on-mycelium.md) §1.

## v2.2.0 release — 2026-07-16 (tag `v2.2.0`)

A hardening MINOR since v2.1.0. Wire **v12** (PREV 11) unchanged — a fully backwards-compatible
rolling upgrade (rolling-upgrade + prev-wire gates green). Release gate **CI-green** — *not* just
`make check-full`: this cycle taught that the local gate misses the live-node/cross-language CI jobs
(see [testing](testing/testing.md) § "`make check-full` is NOT the whole CI gate"), which is how a
`mycelium-reason` trace-replay regression sat red for ~25 commits. Highlights:

- **Five-pass adversarial self-audit** (`docs/analysis/ratings.md` Runs 50–58) — ~40 correctness fixes,
  each with an executable regression gate. Consensus: cross-group quorum split-brain on even N,
  `elect_leader`/overlay split-brain, acceptor equivocation, vote double-count + impersonation, lease
  clock-domain. Convergence: **value-blind anti-entropy digest** (certified diverged nodes as
  converged → permanent silent divergence), HLC saturation/wrap, the store live-entry cap
  (tombstone-counting + overwrite-drop). Membership/connection: SWIM self-incarnation overflow,
  self-peering, writer reap/evict orphan, **snapshot tombstone-resurrection across restart**. Gateway:
  two unauthenticated **node-abort** inputs (`from_secs_f64`, `parse_hex32`), **JWT `aud`/`iss`
  bypass**, rate-aggregate overflow (limiter bypass), unclamped `fill_ratio` (584M-year sleep), the
  inert signal reorder buffer, and more. Companions: blackboard startup-lag split-brain + backfill,
  and the reason trace-replay CI regression.
- **Input-fuzz gate** — a proptest suite under overflow-checks (`store`/`config`/`capability`/`rate`/
  `hlc`/`swim_membership`) + the nightly `frame_apply` cargo-fuzz target: unchecked arithmetic on a
  gossiped/config value fails the build. The invariant: *arithmetic on untrusted values must
  saturate/clamp*. Not yet comprehensive — Robustness in `ratings.md` stays floored pending a clean pass.
- **Identity-authentication — Phase 1a** (`tls::ed25519_key_from_cert_der`, zero-dep) + the phased
  design `docs/design/identity-authentication.md` (the anchor for closing the `sys/identity` poisoning
  gap; CFT-not-BFT, defense-in-depth). The "signed by the old key" overclaim in the rotation docs was
  corrected — the entry is unsigned.
- **`/ready` semantics changed** — startup-complete, not soft-state-advertised; a no-capability node is
  no longer un-deployable behind a k8s readiness gate. Plus new public API `Blackboard::is_primary`/
  `is_secondary`.

Full notes: `CHANGELOG.md` § [2.2.0].

## v2.1.0 release — 2026-07-15 (tag `v2.1.0`)

The first MINOR since v2.0.0 (tag 2026-07-04). Wire **v12** (PREV 11) unchanged — a fully
backwards-compatible rolling upgrade. Cut from CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`; release gate `make
check-full` green (clippy feature-matrix + wasm-host clippy + **794 tests, 0 failed**). Highlights:

- **`LockService`** (`agent.consensus().locks()`) — the ergonomic distributed-lock service: blocking
  acquire (`lock(name, ttl, wait)`), scoped `with_lock(...)` (release guaranteed on every exit path),
  and a **monotonic-HLC fencing token** (the ballot regressed under gossip lag; the token is now the
  winning commit's HLC — monotonic across successive holders).
- **#164 — `distributed_lock` correctness** (two *Critical*, execution-confirmed): (A) acquire
  returned on the local optimistic commit, so two racers both got a guard (no mutual exclusion,
  reproduced `winners == 2`); (B) release tombstoned the plain key while the authoritative lock lives
  at `consensus/committed/lock/{name}`, so a taken lock was **permanently unreleasable**. Fixed with
  the converged-holder discipline + a real consensus lease; the HTTP gateway lock got the same fix.
  Three regression gates, all verified failing pre-fix.
- **`connect_peer` / `disconnect_peer`** — pin + actively warm a direct forwarding route to an
  RPC-heavy peer (survives forwarding-target rebuilds); the tuple-space pins both directions. Plus
  the other Fixed items: self-targeted Individual-signal flood, tuple-space discovery-wait +
  late-secondary backfill, HTTP `SO_REUSEADDR`.
- **CI-gated Docker cluster suites** (`cluster-suites.yml`) — `make test` (13 scenarios) +
  `make test-overlay` on substrate PRs/merges/nightly, no retries by design.
- **Examples/docs rework** — the single faceted **capability matrix** front door (every example
  fingerprinted by layer + facet, each linking to its run-doc); two artifact-library **browser
  showcases** (`provisioning_viz` autonomic self-heal · `catalog_viz` origin-death survival); the
  `## Loads` banner (each runtime-loading demo declares what it installs); the **UI-example contract**
  (every browser demo: gateway+metrics, Ops Console link, concepts box); and `philosophy.html` →
  GitHub-readable `philosophy.md`.

Full notes: `CHANGELOG.md` § [2.1.0].

## Post-v2.0: downstream on-ramp + hardening (2026-07-04/06)

- **`mycelium-wiki` curator step-down** (#127): the companion (group-scoped LLM-curated wiki,
  control-plane/data-plane — shipped 2026-07-03) gained a split-brain guard. The election settles on a
  fixed window, so a lost gossip race could leave two nodes self-elected — both writing the shared store
  with no recovery. A curator **sentinel** now applies lowest-id-wins *continuously* (a higher-id curator
  resigns → returns to the reader failover-watch), with the deterministic canary
  `dual_curators_reconcile_to_a_single_writer`. Root-caused as a single-writer defect (analysis Run 34,
  Major); red-before/green-after on the CI `Wiki (data plane)` job.
- **Downstream-integrator on-ramp** (#125, #126 + direct docs): a two-audience front door —
  `docs/guide/faq.md` (human orientation: is-this-for-me / which-primitive / why-not-X) and
  `docs/guide/building-on-mycelium.md` (the integrator contract: public-API-only rule, reserved KV
  prefixes, the invariants, a copyable `CLAUDE.md` snippet) — linked from the README (two-audience split)
  and the crate-root doc (surfaces on docs.rs). Plus the tuple-space **`redistribution`** worked example
  (equal footing with blackboard `microgrid` / wiki `wiki_chat`), the README four-paper corpus DOIs, and
  `/wiki-lint` **extended** to guard the front-door docs that *restate* code facts against doc-vs-code
  drift (caught a `schema()`→`schemas()` slip on its first pass).
- **Coop suite hardening** (#128): the `elastic_intent` demo's CI-load flake fixed structurally — a
  bidirectional-signed-propagation readiness gate (keeps the TLS identity-exchange window out of the
  convergence poll) + a self-heal window sized past the ~12 s governor cooldown. Verified 14/14 local +
  CI green (the previously-flaking `Food-Rescue Co-op suite` job).
- **Opacity control-signal-shed fix** (#129, 2026-07-06): a *real liveness bug* hiding behind a 10-run
  "flaky" test. The opacity governor emits `BOUNDARY_OPAQUE`/`TRANSPARENT` at `System` scope, and
  `ops::deliver_locally` probabilistically sheds non-`Individual` signals by `combined_fill`; under CI
  gossip-drain starvation the governor's single boundary-transition emission could be shed from *local*
  delivery — the "I'm now shedding" signal dropped by the shedding mechanism, precisely under load.
  Fixed by exempting boundary-transition kinds from the local shed (like `Individual`); deterministic
  regression `ops::delivery_shed_tests::boundary_transition_signals_are_never_locally_shed` (verified to
  fail without the fix). Root-caused by a deliberate dig (analysis Run 37, Major) after three prior
  "resolutions" mis-treated it as scheduling latency.
- **v3.0 positioning** (2026-07-05/06): a pattern-landscape scan established the
  substrate covers the *coordination* pattern space **natively or by composition of native primitives**
  (only ANP wire-protocol conformance needs new code; orchestrator is a non-goal). Recorded **two
  primary v3.0 deliverables** — `mycelium-reason` (LLM-authoring DX) and `mycelium-guardrails`
  (structural, coordinator-free guardrails) — plus packaging candidates. RAG / HITL / *content*
  guardrails are framed as **use-case functions** (external services accessed *through* the mesh — the
  wiki precedent), not substrate work. Homes: `ROADMAP.md` → v3.0 · `docs/wiki/domain/pattern-coverage.md`
  · `docs/plans/mycelium-{reason,guardrails}.md`. **Both primaries shipped 2026-07-08 (#130–#139) — see
  the two entries below;** this bullet records the positioning that preceded them (was "PROPOSED, not
  started" when written).

- **Artifact library — steps 1–5 shipped** (2026-07-07, commits `910c1ff`…`22ac02b`; design record
  `docs/design/artifact-library.md`): the durable origin tier + install generalization for
  `mycelium-wasm-host`. **Data:** `FsLibrarySource` (content-addressed blob dir, complete-or-absent
  writes) + the signed **manifest** (the library's own catalogue; publisher keys stay in CI) + a
  clean-slate versioned entry encoding with an explicit `ArtifactKind`, provenance now binding the
  *whole entry* (version‖kind‖artifact‖capability — closes a re-labeling hole). **Roles:** the
  **librarian** (`spawn_librarian` — serve + one `artifact/librarian` cap + stateless manifest→KV
  reconcile, signature-scoped) and `MeshArtifactSource::resolving` (holders discovered via the
  capability ring — no hardcoded provider ids). **Install:** `ArtifactRuntime`/`Installed` traits —
  `WasmHost` is now the engine inside *one* runtime; `BlobRuntime` places models/data
  (ranged/streamed pull via `RangedArtifactSource`, temp+rename, activation hook, pluggable probe);
  the `Provisioner` gained a kind registry, eligibility (kind + size budget + **resource
  headroom** — signed per-entry `requires`, `ResourceProbe`, in-flight reservations counted;
  §4.4, step 4b) with a tripwire counter, async `Installing→Live` reservations (token-checked),
  and **real** `{ns}/loading` pct tiers driven by actual bytes. **Honest demos:** `catalog` (runtime-read library → librarian →
  discovered pull → origin killed + library deleted → late joiner installs from a peer cache) and
  `mcp_toolgrowth` (the converter's arithmetic **arrives** as a new committed WASM fixture,
  bridged over MCP; activation-vs-installation taught explicitly); `llm_agent`'s percent loops
  stay simulated by decision (wasmtime must not enter `make check` via root dev-deps) and say so.
  Lock-order rows 20–22. **Complete** — step 6 shipped (`BlobFetcher`/`PrefetchingSource`/`HttpLibrarySource`: any HTTP(S) blob store, egress-gated, vendor SDKs via the trait); step 7 declined-with-evidence (three async faces already serve every consumer — note §10). **Session tail (same day):** the coverage review found `Installed::probe` was exposed but consumed by nothing — a **probe health pass** now opens every `provision_round` (fail → withdraw → the normal machinery reinstalls once the retracted ad clears the local view; probes are cheap-under-lock by contract); four lifecycle/concurrency tests landed (full per-kind lifecycles incl. blob probe-self-heal + shed-deletes-the-file; failed-install reservation-drop-retry; withdraw-during-install stale teardown), and the **`model_deploy` manual demo** proves the Blob path with a real 19 MB GGUF — **weights + deployment profile as two signed artifacts** (profile → weights by content address; failed-activation-retry is the ordering — note §4.3.1), streamed with honest percent, resolved + activated via `ollama create` (with `ollama show` asserting the arrived SYSTEM prompt is the one running), probe-gated, then generating real tokens (`ArtifactKind` note: a closed crate-owned enum — custom *runtimes* are the open axis, not custom kinds). Open: the crate-naming question only. **Run-38 floor fixed same day** (typed `InstallError` by stage; `mycelium_artifact_*` metrics-facade tripwires + recorder-backed test; the CI **flake tier** — `scripts/ci-retest.sh`, failed-tests-only retry with mandatory flake annotations, the class-level prevention Run 37 asked for).

- **`mycelium-reason` — v3.0 primary #1, LLM-authoring DX, COMPLETE**
  (2026-07-08, PRs #130–#136; plan `docs/plans/mycelium-reason.md` + `…-examples.md`, positioning
  `docs/wiki/domain/pattern-coverage.md` → the LLM-DX axis, guide **chapter 15**). The first *built* v3.0
  deliverable. Preceded by a **code-verified pre-implementation reassessment**
  (five bindings; corrected the 2026-07-07 addenda's overstatement that an attributed
  `cap/{node}/llm/inference` convention existed — it did not; and that resolution consults opacity — it
  does not). **PR #130 — the `mycelium-reason` crate** (public-API-only companion, no `mycelium-wasm-host`
  dep): ① **capability-routed inference** (`serve_model` = model-is-a-prompt-skill `llm/{model}` + a
  parallel attributed `llm-meta/{model}` ad; `InferenceRouter` = resolve → drop opaque nodes → rank by
  pheromone `peer_load` fill → failover — the routing layer the load-blind `resolve` deliberately
  omits), ② **fleet-reasoning traces** (`TraceRecorder`/`replay`/`narrate` on the log overlay, optional
  WS2 audit-chain anchoring under `compliance`), ③ **artifact-aware resume** (demand half:
  `require_model` + structural `await_ready` + `llm/loading` progress), plus the **content-addressed
  blob tier** (`FsBlobStore`/`MeshBlobStore`/`spawn_blob_server` — SHA-256 ids, verify-on-read, verified
  peer fetch, ≤ 8 MiB single-frame v1) and `/gateway/reason/{blob,trace}` routes. Implementation caught a
  real plan error — a single shared trace stream collides same-millisecond HLC keys across writers (the
  HLC's per-node logical counter) and LWW-drops records — fixed with **per-writer substreams**
  `reason/{run_id}/{node}`, merged on HLC at replay. Zero new locks. **PR #131 — the Python tier**
  (Tiers 1+2): **`langgraph-checkpoint-mycelium`** (a `BaseCheckpointSaver` — index rows in gossiped KV
  `ckpt/`/`ckptw/` with metadata inline for payload-free `list`, payloads in the blob tier with one blob
  per channel value so unchanged values dedup across super-steps; sync + async; **cross-node `StateGraph`
  resume proven in CI** — node B continues what node A checkpointed) and **`mycelium.call_typed`** (a
  through-the-mesh prompt-skill call with a balanced-brace JSON scanner + pydantic validation-feedback
  retry; pydantic via the `typed` extra). Landed the repo's **first Python CI job** (`python-sdk`: builds
  the `reason_node` example, boots a two-node mesh, runs both pytest suites — 14 tests). A checkpointer
  edge exposed and fixed the crate's empty-blob path (a typed `None` serializes to zero bytes = `SHA-256("")`;
  an empty fetch reply means *miss*, so `MeshBlobStore::get` answers it from the address alone). Reserved
  prefixes claimed: KV `ckpt/`·`ckptw/`·`log/reason/`, capability `reason/blob-cache`, RPC
  `reason.blob.fetch`. **PRs #132–#136 completed the LangGraph example ladder** (`docs/plans/mycelium-reason-examples.md`,
  built flagship-first): **#132** the routing gateway surface (`POST /gateway/reason/route` + Python
  `ReasonClient`) — needed because `/gateway/llm/call` is single-shot; **#133** the echo-CI **deploy/reheal
  flagship** (a graph's model dependency follows it across node death: checkpoint on A → gossip to B →
  kill A → B reheals the model via the mesh blob fetch + `serve_model` bridge → resume routes to B);
  **#134** a real router-robustness fix the flagship's de-risking surfaced — a killed node poisoned
  routing for ~90 s (capability-freshness window; mesh RPC has no fast-fail), fixed with a **live-SWIM-membership
  filter** (`InferenceRouter` routes only to `peers()`+self) + a **`RouterConfig::failover_timeout`** (8 s;
  non-final attempts fail over fast, the last gets the full budget); canary `liveness_filter_drops_a_non_peer_cap`;
  **#135** rungs 0/1/2/3/5 (`examples/langgraph/`) + the ladder README + a small trace-recording surface
  (`run_id` on the route endpoint); **#136** guide chapter 15 + the **Ollama-manual** real-model variant
  (`examples/coop/src/bin/reheal_deploy.rs` — real GGUF via `model_deploy`'s `BlobRuntime`, `supervise(min=1)`-driven
  reheal, node-unique Ollama names; manual/not-CI, compile-verified only). All CI-green. Open: the
  `mycelium-reason` crate-naming question (shared with the artifact library); the Ollama variant is
  compile-verified but unrun (needs a live Ollama + GGUF).

- **`mycelium-guardrails` — v3.0 primary #2, structural coordinator-free guardrails, COMPLETE**
  (2026-07-08, PRs #137–#139; plan `docs/plans/mycelium-guardrails.md`, positioning
  `docs/wiki/domain/pattern-coverage.md` → Structural guardrails, guide **chapter 16**). *What an agent
  may do* — packaged on the public API only. Preceded by a **code-verified reassessment** (six bindings)
  whose headline reshaped the plan: the mechanisms are real but deliver **three distinct strength tiers**,
  so an honest policy must say which clause compiles to which. **PR #137 — the crate**: a tier-labelled
  `Policy` → `apply()` compiling one declaration to **Tier A** boundary (`join_group` — drop-before-handler,
  self-imposed prevention), **Tier B** `AgentPolicy` (tool allow/deny + budgets, self-imposed at state
  transitions), **Tier C** `authorized_callers` (**hard prevention** — an unauthorized invoke is rejected
  at the provider, the one gate that's real prevention not promise-strength); `Policy::strength_report()`
  is the legibility (it discloses each clause's tier); the **self-imposed stance** is a decision (no remote
  policy authority — a central policy server is the chokepoint non-goal). It ships the reusable Tier-C gate
  + **denial sealing** (`check_caller`/`guarded_rpc_serve` seal `Invoke`/`Denied` into the tamper-evident
  chain) that previously only SkillRunner had. **PR #138 — the policy-audit verification tool**
  (`prove_denials`/`narrate_proof`): reconstruct a provider's chain, re-verify it, and prove the guardrail
  fired — with **honest framing** encoded in the output (it PROVES *this provider tamper-evidently sealed
  stopping X*; it DOES NOT prove *X could not have done Y anywhere* — per-node chains, only guarded caps
  seal) + the watchable `guardrail_wedge` example. **PR #139 — chapter 16 + `guardrail_fleet`** (all three
  tiers *actually firing* in a constructive co-op fleet; the Tier-A boundary *drop* — a non-event — proven
  by a positive/bounded-negative/bracket sequence). Revocation is **self-sovereign** (`revoke_identity_key`
  — a node revokes only its own keys; the levers over a misbehaving peer are narrowing its allowlist or
  dropping its role, never pushing policy in). All CI-green; a `Guardrails (v3.0)` CI job. Zero new locks.
  Open: broader packaging refinements + the crate-naming question.

## The self-audit series

`docs/analysis/ratings.md` — 37 runs; methodology M2 since Run 16 (execution-evidence gate,
falsification probes, calibration ledger). Run 28 (2026-07-02): 5 findings (3 Major), all
fixed same day — the oversized-write family, the state-machine commit race, RUSTSEC-2026-0188.
Run 34 (2026-07-05): the `mycelium-wiki` curator split-brain (Major, single-writer, #127). Run 37
(2026-07-06): the opacity control-signal-shed (Major, #129). 27 calibration-ledger entries.
**Methodology upgraded 2026-07-06 (bright line at Run 37):** *current score = current state* — a bug
found + fixed + deterministically gated in the same run scores its fixed end-state (not the old cap-at-6),
and finding-and-fixing a bug never lowers a score (accountability for past over-scoring lives in the
ledger); an *unknown-unknowns reserve* + *carried-score decay* temper confident 8s; and **past run scores
are never retroactively rewritten** (a time-series is only meaningful if its measurements stand). Pre-37
runs are dated snapshots under the prior rule.
