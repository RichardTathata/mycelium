# Runtime invariants — do not "fix" these

↑ [architecture](architecture.md) · siblings: [layers-and-crates](layers-and-crates.md)

Invariants that look like bugs or optimization targets and are neither. Each has burned a
session or shipped a regression before being written down.

## Layer III posture: detection, not prevention

The substrate never enforces the `consensus/` prefix — a rogue writer can clobber
`consensus/committed/{slot}` and LWW accepts it. The deliberate response is the
**commit-conflict tripwire** (listener refuses to re-endorse a conflicting COMMIT, `warn!`s,
increments `SystemStats::commit_conflicts`). Do **not** add a `consensus/`-prefix write guard
to `apply_and_notify` — that teaches Layer I a Layer III law and inverts the dependency.
The same posture governs the `sys/` namespace tripwire (`sys_namespace_violations`, see
[security](../security.md)) and the RBAC design generally.

**Epoch-leased commitments** (`ConsensusConfig::committed_lease_secs`, default `None` =
permanent): when set, readers apply the capability-style read-side freshness convention —
expired lease reads as not-committed and the slot reopens. Renewal = re-proposing the *same*
value; a different value while live returns `Superseded`. `consensus_rx` stays the raw KV view.

**Listener handlers register synchronously.** `start_consensus_listener` registers
PROPOSE/COMMIT receivers *before* spawning the voter task. Registration inside the task's
first poll silently dropped proposals racing startup (single-node tests self-quorum and never
notice). Keep it synchronous through any refactor.

## Individual-scope routing: forwarding stays unconditional

`SignalScope::Individual` carries RPC and consensus votes. The gossip loop sends directly to
a directly-peered target (latency optimization) and otherwise **falls back to flooding** —
the seen-set dedups, hop-TTL bounds it. Pre-2026-06-12 the fallback was "optimized" to a
silent drop, which broke RPC and ballot voting in partial meshes. Only *admission* is scoped
(`Boundary::admits`); forwarding never is. Regression gates:
`test_individual_signal_reaches_unpeered_target_via_relay`,
`test_individual_consumers_over_random_partial_meshes` (both in `src/lib_tests.rs`).

**The one legitimate termination: the frame's own target (2026-07-10, #162).** An Individual
frame addressed to *this* node has nowhere further to route — admission already delivered it
locally. Pre-fix it still entered the forward path (both self-emits like mailbox
deliver-to-self and relayed frames arriving at their destination traverse the gossip queue),
found no route to itself, and **flooded the cluster** until seen-set/TTL death — plus a
topology-pressure warn naming the node itself and spurious `individual_flood_fallbacks`
counts (this noise complicated the #161 diagnosis). The gossip shard now terminates
self-addressed Individual frames before any forwarding logic (`src/agent/tasks.rs`). This is
**routing at the terminal, not scope admission** — do not cite it as precedent for
conditional forwarding: any frame addressed *elsewhere* still forwards unconditionally.
Gate: `self_targeted_signal_does_not_flood` (`src/lib_tests.rs`, verified failing pre-fix).

**Flood-relay is correct but slow for RPC — pin RPC-heavy pairs.** The direct-send path only
fires for a peer in the *forwarding-target set*, and that set **deliberately de-pins non-active
peers** (seed-scalability, WS-B M4: avoid O(N) pinning on shared seeds — `src/agent/tasks.rs`,
the target rebuild on peer-list change). So an Individual-scoped frame to a peer that isn't a
current forwarding target degrades to flood-relay: fine for a one-shot signal, but a
request-response **RPC** pays a multi-hop round-trip and can miss its deadline (this was the S13
tuple-space flake — a secondary→primary `take` timing out at HTTP 408, grounded in node logs;
#150). The fix is **`GossipAgent::connect_peer(peer)` / `disconnect_peer(peer)`** (`src/agent/topology.rs`):
a `pinned_peers` set (papaya, lock-free — no lock-order row) that the flood-fallback honours
(`targets.contains(t) || pinned_peers.contains(t)`) on *every* rebuild, so a specifically-pinned
peer keeps a direct route without undoing the seed de-pinning. `connect_peer` also **actively
warms** the link — writers connect lazily on first frame (`mycelium-core/src/writer.rs`
`run_peer_writer`), so it spawns the writer and sends a Ping on call, establishing the connection
*ahead* of the first RPC rather than on its deadline. Call it a little ahead of the RPC (a
background keeper), not inline — the tuple-space secondary runs exactly such a warm-keeper in
`become_secondary` (`mycelium-tuple-space/src/lib.rs`). Any RPC-heavy relationship toward a
specific peer should pin it; general signalling should not (that is what the seed de-pinning
protects). Reusable lesson: **an Individual-scoped RPC's latency depends on whether its target is
a direct forwarding target — for a hot pair, pin the route and warm it, don't rely on flood-relay.**
Regression gate: integration scenario 13 (`make test`, `13_tuple_space.sh`) plus the hosted
cluster-suites CI workflow. *Correction (2026-07-10):* an earlier version of this note cited
`make test-overlay` S13 — a different scenario (consensus shared-log) that never exercised this
path; the flaky test was always **integration** S13. The pin+warm was also only half the fix:
the other half was the tuple-space spurious-promotion split-brain
([companions/tuple-space](../companions/tuple-space.md), #158) — flood-relay latency masked it
locally, the hosted 2-core runner exposed it.

## KV floods the cluster — a group is not a data-isolation boundary

`WireMessage::Data` (the KV path) always forwards `ForwardHint::All`
(`mycelium-core/src/connection.rs` — the seen-set dedups, hop-TTL bounds it): **Layer-I KV
replicates to every node in the cluster, unconditionally.** `Boundary::admits` gates only
whether a node *acts on a Signal*; it never scopes KV propagation. Consequences a contributor
*will* get wrong (it was mis-stated once in the wiki design record and caught by this lint):

- A **capability group** (`join_group`, `gcap/`) organises *who participates* — it never
  scopes *what replicates*. Group-scoped state (e.g. a `wiki/{group}/…` namespace) is
  **namespaced and access-gated, not replication-isolated**: every cluster node holds the
  bytes regardless of membership. *(This invariant is why the `mycelium-wiki` plan moved its
  durable corpus **out** of KV to an external store — a group's wiki is not KV-isolated, so a
  large per-group corpus would flood every node; only its small evaporating proposal queue
  stays in KV. See `docs/plans/mycelium-wiki.md` → Architecture.)*
- Therefore an in-cluster access label (RBAC clearance on a key, an `authorized_callers`
  ACL) is a **served-path gate** — governance + audit (detection-not-prevention), never
  confidentiality. It withholds the *convenient* read path; it cannot un-replicate bytes a
  node already holds.
- The genuine **data-isolation boundary is the cluster/mesh** — peer admission (TLS
  mutual-auth: who you connect to and authenticate). Bytes that must never *reach* a node
  belong in a **separate cluster** (its KV never peers in). This is the domain-level
  self-election of
  [coordinator-free-recursion](../../domain/theory/coordinator-free-recursion.md) — the
  boundary that isolates *data* is one level up from the group.
- For "the bytes may *reach* a node but it must not *read* them" **within** one cluster, the
  answer is **application/envelope payload encryption** — the value is ciphertext before the
  KV write, so the substrate only ever holds opaque bytes and only key-holders decrypt. This
  is **not** WS3 `DataAtRestCipher`: WS3 is **on-disk only** (`mycelium-core/src/persistence.rs`
  — "data in memory is not [protected]"), one cluster-uniform cipher per node, so every node
  still holds the *plaintext in memory* — WS3 is disk-theft defence-in-depth, not a per-page
  or cross-node read boundary.

## Fan-out activation is event-driven

The connection handler publishes the peer list the moment a new peer is inserted (Ping
receipt); waiting for the health monitor's next tick left inbound-only nodes (seeds, tuple
primaries) mute for live sends for up to 2× `health_check_interval`. The health monitor
remains the reconciler/evictor, not the activator.

Three corollaries hardened 2026-07-21 (the cold-start saga —
[full log](../.log/2026-07-21-mailbox-llm-flake.md)); each ships a regression when forgotten:

- **Peer learning is Ping-borne** — only `Ping` carries a full `NodeId`; `Data`/`SignedData`
  carry an id-hash and *cannot* admit or activate a peer. Both activation twins must stay in
  sync: the TCP Ping arm (`connection.rs`) and SWIM's `ApplyEffect::BecameAlive` (`swim.rs`).
  Gates: `test_cold_start_rpc_both_directions_before_first_tick_{swim,no_swim}` (health
  interval cranked so no tick can rescue the handshake).
- **Every Ping carries the peer-exchange sample** — startup pings and ping-backs included. An
  empty-`known_peers` ping breaks cluster *introduction*: a fresh trio whose hub dies pre-tick
  ends mutually unknown and staleness-evicts to total isolation (the failover regression).
- **Activation caps size by the union** (`known.max(current + 1)`), never the peers map alone —
  the watch is bootstrap-seeded before those peers surface in the map, and map-only sizing let
  an early activation refuse the only *live* member. Gate:
  `became_alive_activates_despite_bootstrap_seeded_watch`.
- Watch publishes are RMW-atomic (`send_if_modified` only) — rule + loom model in
  [lock-free-and-atomics](../concurrency/lock-free-and-atomics.md).

## Anti-entropy is chunked; KV writes are size-gated (2026-07-02)

`StateResponse` is sent as multiple frames under a per-chunk byte budget
(`mycelium-core/src/connection.rs`), so a store larger than one frame can still bootstrap a
late joiner; an individually un-frameable legacy entry is skipped by name. Upstream,
`kv_set`/`kv_set_async` reject writes over `framing::MAX_KV_WRITE_BYTES` outright, and the
per-peer writer drops a `FrameTooLarge` frame *without* tearing down the connection. Gates:
`test_late_joiner_converges_past_frame_sized_store_via_chunked_anti_entropy`,
`test_oversized_value_is_rejected_outright_and_cluster_stays_healthy`. History: analysis
Run 28 Finding 1 (`docs/analysis/ratings.md`).

## `subscribe_log_group` is single-active — do NOT turn it into a load-balanced work queue (#149)

Two different patterns keep getting conflated because the word "consumer group" (and the S11
"task auction" framing) implies work-sharing. They are distinct, and the substrate has a
**separate correct primitive for each**:

- **Exact-once *ordered log consumption*** → `subscribe_log_group` / the gateway
  `/gateway/overlay/log/group/subscribe`. Contract: **at most one active consumer at a time**,
  failover on death. Achieved (`src/agent/http.rs`; gate: overlay S11) by a **leased consensus
  claim with converged-holder confirmation**: `cluster_propose` commits **optimistically against a
  node's *local* committed view** (`src/consensus.rs`), so two near-simultaneous proposers can
  both commit — the return is **not** trustworthy for mutual exclusion. But commit-keys are
  LWW-by-HLC, so the *converged* holder is deterministic: after committing, read the converged
  committed holder (`live_committed_value`) and only that node consumes; losers stand by **without
  releasing** (a tombstone would clear the winner's claim). The winner drains a **private** offset
  (exact-once by construction) and renews the lease → a standby takes over on death.
  **Reusable lesson:** a consensus-backed lock is not mutually exclusive on the *propose return* —
  confirm via the converged committed value. The `mycelium-core` library
  `KvHandle::subscribe_log_group` is the **best-effort** version (LWW claim, no consensus — can
  double-deliver under contention; documented as such).
- **Load-balanced exactly-once *work distribution*** (each item claimed by exactly one of many
  competing workers) → the **`mycelium-tuple-space`** companion (O(1) FIFO `take`, single-owner
  claim). `examples/fluid_pipeline` is the worked demo.

**The trap (do not re-attempt):** making the log-group *load-balance* by handing entries off
between consumers per-item. It cannot work with a single advancing offset. A **bare LWW offset**
lets a peer read stale and re-drain (double-delivery); a **consensus offset** can't be
re-advanced (a second `cluster_propose` to the same slot returns `Superseded`, not a new value)
and per-item consensus floods the engine (starves other consensus users — it broke overlay S12).
Competitive per-item consumption is the *tuple-space's* job, by design; don't rebuild it on a
log. History: #149 (the full got-10 → got-1 → got-10 dead-end is on the issue).

## Distributed locks — the same converged-holder discipline, and the HLC fencing token (#164–#166)

`ConsensusHandle::distributed_lock` (and its ergonomic layer `LockService`,
`agent.consensus().locks()` — blocking `lock`, scoped `with_lock`) was the reusable lesson
above **failing in shipping code**, found live #164 (probes, not review): (a) it returned on the
*local* optimistic commit → **no mutual exclusion** (two racers both got a guard, `winners == 2`);
(b) `do_release` tombstoned the plain `lock/{name}` key while the authoritative lock lives at
`consensus/committed/lock/{name}` → release was a **no-op** and the lock was permanently
unreleasable. Fixed #165 with the identical discipline: acquire confirms the converged committed
value before returning; release clears the **authoritative** slot + lease, guarded on the exact
committed value (`{holder}:{nonce}`) so a stale guard never clears a live holder's claim. The
`ttl` is now a real consensus **lease** (`committed_lease_secs`), not a decorative JSON field.

**The fencing token must be the commit HLC, not the ballot (#166).** A fencing token must be
**monotonic** across successive holders (Kleppmann). The consensus *ballot* is not: it is
per-node-local and gossip-lagged, so a later holder can commit at a *lower* ballot — the
`distributed_lock` example showed it regressing (a legitimate write wrongly fenced). `LockGuard::token`
is therefore the winning commit's **HLC** (`live_committed_with_hlc`) — strictly increasing across
holders, because each holder causally observes the prior release. The gateway returns it as a
**decimal string** (the HLC exceeds JS `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`; the TS SDK already expected a string,
Python parses it to `int`). **Reusable lesson:** when you need a monotonic token out of consensus,
reach for the HLC of the commit, never the ballot. Gates: `distributed_lock_grants_single_holder_under_race`,
`distributed_lock_release_frees_for_reacquire`, `distributed_lock_stale_release_does_not_clobber`
(`src/agent/overlay_consistent.rs`), `fencing_token_is_monotonic_across_acquisitions`
(`src/agent/lock_service.rs`).
The runnable demo is `examples/distributed_lock.rs`.

## Persistence: the store is never behind the WAL, and a snapshot never discards a WAL record

Three durability invariants, written down after an external review (2026-09-05) reproduced three
P1 defects with deterministic probes — each had shipped in every tagged release with persistence
(`mycelium-core/src/persistence.rs` module doc is canon; gates in its `durability_tests`).

**1. Apply, then persist.** Every write site (`ops.rs` `kv_set*`/`kv_delete*`, `connection.rs`
gossip receive + anti-entropy + quorum evidence, `mailbox.rs`, gateway `kv_write`) calls
`apply_and_notify` *before* `WalHandle::append*`. Pre-fix the async paths awaited the Flush-mode
ack first, and the writer runs its threshold snapshot **in the same poll as the ack, with no yield**
— so the store scan lacked the acknowledged write and step 4 (WAL truncation) erased its only
copy. Do not "restore" WAL-first ordering for a durability-before-visibility feel: the sync path
never had it, and the snapshot is taken from the store.

**2. The snapshot merges the WAL tail before truncating.** `do_snapshot` reads `wal.bin` (every
record since the last truncation) and folds it into the store scan under the store's own
`lww_wins` (`sync_entry_wins`), so the persistence layer is correct **regardless of caller
ordering** — invariant 1 is defence in depth, this is the guarantee. The writer is single-task:
nothing lands between the read-back and the truncation. Cost: one bounded read (≤
`snapshot_wal_threshold` records) per snapshot. `wal_file.flush()` precedes the read-back because
tokio's `File::write_all` may still be in flight in `Async`/`Os` mode.

**3. Replay is LWW, not a watermark.** `replay` used to skip records with
`timestamp <= snapshot_hlc`, treating an HLC as a WAL *position*. A delayed remote update carries
an older HLC than the local clock at snapshot time yet is accepted and WAL-appended *after* the
snapshot — the filter dropped it on restart even for a key the snapshot lacked (anti-entropy
would repair it from peers eventually; a single node or a cold cluster restart lost it). Every
record is now replayed through `apply_fn` = `apply_and_notify`, whose LWW lets the snapshot's newer
entry win on its own. `KvSnapshot::snapshot_hlc` stays on disk, informational only.

**An ack is a durability claim.** `append` (Flush), `append_sync`, `trigger_snapshot` return
`BrokenPipe` when the writer task is gone — never `Ok` by default (`rx.await.unwrap_or(Ok(()))`
was the pre-fix shape). `append_sync` forces `fdatasync` in every `SyncMode` (its doc always
claimed so; the writer only synced in `Flush`). Consensus folds the result into
`ConsensusResult::Committed { persisted }` — `false` is *committed cluster-wide, not on this
node's stable storage* (logged at `error`; gateway JSON carries `"persisted"`). The
Async/Os-mode `append` and `append_try` remain fire-and-forget by documented design.

Gates (`persistence.rs::durability_tests`): `regression_snapshot_retains_wal_record_acked_before_local_apply`,
`regression_writer_threshold_snapshot_right_after_ack_keeps_write` (through the real writer task,
replay taken while it is alive — a clean shutdown would mask the loss), `snapshot_wal_merge_follows_store_lww`,
`regression_replay_keeps_wal_record_older_than_snapshot_watermark`,
`replay_without_watermark_still_lets_snapshot_win_same_key`, `regression_closed_writer_never_acks_success`,
`regression_writer_dying_mid_request_is_an_error`, `append_sync_fdatasyncs_in_async_mode`.
Not gated: `Committed { persisted: false }` end-to-end (needs a writer death or disk fault inside
a running agent — the unit path is covered by the closed-writer test).
