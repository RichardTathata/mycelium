# Docker cluster suites — the CI-gated cross-node tests

↑ [testing](testing.md) · sibling: [scale-tests](scale-tests.md)

The two multi-container suites cover what in-process tests structurally cannot: real TCP,
anti-entropy over a Docker bridge, container restarts, late joiners, and cross-node RPC under
genuine network latency. **Both are CI-gated since 2026-07-10** (`.github/workflows/
cluster-suites.yml`) — wiring them into CI is what surfaced five substrate/companion defects
in one week (#149 exact-once, #150 flood-relay + spurious-promotion split-brain, #159
succession data loss, #160 restart AddrInUse panic). None were reproducible on fast local
hardware alone.

## The suites

| Suite | Command | Shape | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| Integration | `make test` | 4 nodes (a, b, late-joiner c, mgmt) + runner | 13 scenarios: KV convergence/persistence, restarts, signals, capabilities, scatter-gather, AFN, prompt skills, tuple space (`tests/integration/scenarios/`) |
| Overlay | `make test-overlay` | 3 nodes + runner | S11 task auction (exact-once), S12 leader election + consensus config, S13 shared reasoning log (`tests/overlay/`) |

Note the trap that cost a day: **overlay "S13" (shared log) and integration scenario 13
(tuple space) are different tests.** Execution evidence must name the suite that tests the
claim (calibration ledger, 2026-07-10).

## The CI gate (`cluster-suites.yml`)

- Runs on substrate PRs (path-filtered: `src/`, the crates, harnesses, `docker/`, the demo),
  merges to main (same filter — docs-only pushes skip), nightly 05:00 UTC, and
  `workflow_dispatch`.
- **No retries, by design.** A red gate is signal; both historic flakes were real bugs fixed
  at the substrate layer, not papered over (#155/#158). Do not add retry loops to make it
  green — diagnose (the harness self-diagnoses, below).
- The 100-node **scale** suites run separately: `.github/workflows/scale-nightly.yml`,
  nightly 06:00 UTC on a **self-hosted** runner labelled `mycelium-scale` (hosted 2-core
  runners hit the Docker-bridge iptables ceiling ~50 nodes — [scale-tests](scale-tests.md)).

## Harness diagnostics (a red gate names its own cause)

Added 2026-07-10 after a bare "FAIL" with empty stderr cost several diagnosis rounds:

- **ERR trap + errtrace** (`tests/integration/lib/helpers.sh`): every scenario runs
  `set -euo pipefail` with `curl -sf`, which dies silently — the trap prints
  `script:line: command exited N` for any unguarded failure (`if`/`&&`/`||`-guarded helper
  internals stay silent). `set -o errtrace` is load-bearing: without it the trap is NOT
  inherited by shell *functions*, so a curl inside a helper (e.g. `gw_kv_set`) still died
  silently — exactly the undiagnosable AFN failure (#161). Any new harness lib must set both.
- **Node-log dump**: `make test` dumps the last 200 log lines per node when the runner fails
  — this is what named the spurious-promotion split-brain and the AddrInUse panic directly.
- **Phase-0 data-plane barrier** (`tests/integration/run.sh`): health + mgmt visibility prove
  the control plane only; the barrier proves one KV round-trip in each direction (bounded
  60 s, warn-not-block) before scenarios run, so scenario windows measure convergence, not
  bring-up lag.
- **S13 take-loop instrumentation** (`13_tuple_space.sh`): each take reports iteration + HTTP
  code + body on failure (408 vs 5xx tell different stories). **The put loop beside it went
  uninstrumented until 2026-09-15** — it piped `curl -sf` into `jq` and so reported a lost put as
  `jq exited 28`, with no iteration, status or body. Instrumentation added to one loop is not
  instrumentation added to the scenario; check the siblings.
- **Truncate the `-o` body file before every request** (`13_tuple_space.sh`, 2026-09-15): curl
  leaves it untouched when no response arrives, so a failure report prints the *previous*
  iteration's body. The run that found this reported `take #9 ... body='{"id":8,…}'` — which reads
  as a wrong-id bug and was a timeout. A diagnostic that invents a second, fictional defect is
  worse than no diagnostic.
- **Client deadlines must outlive the callee's own budget** (2026-09-15): every single-shot
  assertion in S13 was set below the server-side budget of the call it made (5 s against a put
  whose worst case is 16 s; exactly 10 s against a take's 16 s), so a request frame lost to writer
  backoff surfaced as curl's impatience rather than the gateway's answer. Raising those is *not*
  the forbidden timeout-widening — see [testing](testing.md) §*A client deadline below the
  server's budget is a defect, not a flake* for the distinction and the check that precedes any
  deadline change.

## The operating lesson

A CPU-starved 2-core runner is a *feature*: it stretches timing windows (cap propagation,
TIME_WAIT, connection warmup) into ranges fast local hardware never exhibits. Every "hosted
CI is flaky" episode this suite has produced so far decomposed into a real defect — including the
2026-09-15 pair that went red at the v2.5.0 tag, where the defect was arithmetic in the scenario's
own deadlines and the merge it landed next to turned out to be a pure-insertion diff. Diagnose
from captured node logs, never from code-reading — four wrong hypotheses in the #150 arc were
each killed by data (full narrative: `.log/2026-07-09-connect-peer-s13.md`,
`.log/2026-07-10-spurious-promotion-s13.md` in [dev](../dev.md)'s log).
