## Run the full feature matrix before pushing

**`make check` is the one-command pre-push gate** — clippy across the feature matrix CI enforces
(feature-matrix + `--no-default-features` + core), in ~3 min with no wasmtime compile. Run it before
every push. `make check-full` adds the test suites + the (slow) wasm-host clippy; run it before a
release or when you have touched wasm-host / a feature-conditional path.

`make check` expands to CI's clippy set; the full CI gate (for reference) is:

```bash
cargo test --lib --features tls,metrics,a2a,llm
cargo clippy --lib --tests --features tls,metrics,a2a,llm -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --lib --tests --features compliance -- -D warnings   # in make check since 2026-07-22 — WITHOUT this, compliance-gated code went un-linted locally (the guardrails CI job caught it)
cargo test --lib --features compliance          # WS1 RBAC + WS2 audit + WS4 OIDC + WS5 rotation
cargo test --lib --no-default-features --features gateway   # consensus-free embed
cargo test -p mycelium-core                                 # the substrate suite (codec/framing/hlc/store/swim) — RUNS as of 2026-07-11
cargo clippy -p mycelium-core --lib --tests -- -D warnings  # core's own tests are a separate lint scope
cargo clippy --lib --no-default-features -- -D warnings     # minimal embed — catches feature-gated dead code
cargo clippy -p mycelium-wasm-host --all-targets -- -D warnings   # wasm-host embeds mycelium default-features=false
```

**`make check-full` is NOT the whole CI gate — a green local run does not prove CI is green.** The
block above is the *Rust lib + clippy* set. CI **also** runs **live-node / cross-language integration
jobs** that `make check-full` does not: **Reason (v3.0 Tier-3)** and **Python SDK + LangGraph** (spin
up real `reason_node` binaries and drive them over HTTP/Python), the **Food-Rescue coop demo suite**
(`examples/coop/ci_smoke.sh` — 12 multi-node demos), **Blackboard / WASM-host / AFN** smokes, the
**Docker cluster suites**, and the nightly **fuzz** job. These exercise *runtime behaviour across the
network and across crates* that no `cargo test --lib` reaches.

**The lesson (2026-07-16, cost ~25 red commits reported "green").** A pass-1 audit fix salted the
`kv().append` on-disk key with the node id (`log/{stream}/{hlc:016x}/{node}` — core BUG 4). That
changed a **shared core *contract***, and `mycelium-reason::replay` — a **separate crate** with its
**own** `log/`-key parser — read the HLC from the (now wrong) last segment and silently dropped every
trace event. `make check-full` was green the whole time (reason's unit tests covered only formatting,
never a `record→replay` round-trip); only CI's live reason/Python jobs caught it, and it sat red for
~25 commits while each was reported "green" off the local gate alone. Two durable rules fall out:
- **After pushing, check `gh run list` — CI green is the real bar, not `make check-full`.** The local
  gate is necessary, not sufficient.
- **When you change a shared contract** (an on-disk/wire key layout, a KV-prefix convention, an encode
  format), **grep the *whole workspace* for other consumers** — companion crates and integration
  surfaces parse these too, and their parser may not be in any lib test. (The BUG-4 commit fixed the
  `kv_handle`/http log parsers it knew about; reason's was the blind spot.) Fixed by parsing the HLC
  from the salted layout + adding `mycelium-reason` `trace_record_replay_round_trips` (a real
  round-trip gate that fails on the old parser).

**Corollary — a *correct* substrate change can make a timing-sensitive demo flakier.** Same session:
the stricter (correct) `cross_group_quorum` made a 2-node bloc's quorum unanimous, and TLS-signed
consensus drops a vote until the signer's `sys/identity/` gossips in — together they made the coop
`07 · consensus` demo occasionally `Timeout`. The fix is in the **demo's readiness gate** (wait for
identity propagation before proposing + a little ballot headroom), **not** the substrate. A flaky
example demo can be a *correct* substrate change meeting a demo whose startup gate predates it.

**Second corollary — KV-level gates prove *visibility*, not *deliverability*** (the `01 ·
mailbox_llm` flake, 2026-07-21, `1ffe9ea`): a demo can see peers, capabilities, and all
`sys/identity/` keys and *still* drop its first Individual-scoped RPC leg, because each hop's
active forwarding set is published event-driven in the first seconds (the health monitor's first
reconcile is ~`health_check_interval` out). A demo that asserts on an RPC must **warm-up-probe
the exact round-trip it asserts** (retry a throwaway call until one succeeds — a structural gate
at the layer under test), never let the first asserted call double as the path's first exercise.
Any TLS demo doing early Individual-scoped sends needs **both** gates: identity propagation *and*
the round-trip probe. (`catalog` / `provisioning` / `mcp_toolgrowth` make early Individual sends
with neither — same theoretical exposure, so far unexpressed.)

**Feature-gated dead code is a real trap** (bit the diagnostics work, 2026-07-03): an item used
only under `gateway`/`metrics` is *dead* in a `--no-default-features` build (the CI "Gateway-free"
+ "WASM host" jobs run exactly that), and `-D warnings` fails there even though the default and
feature-matrix gates pass. **The fast catcher is `cargo clippy --lib --no-default-features`** (in
`make check`) — it lints the same gateway/metrics-off mycelium lib the slow wasm-host job compiles,
so you rarely need the wasmtime build to catch the trap.

**mycelium-core's suite runs in CI as of 2026-07-11.** Before that it was clippy-*compiled*
(`clippy -p mycelium-core --lib --tests`) but never *run*: `cargo test --lib` tests only the root
`mycelium` package (core is a compiled dependency there, its `#[cfg(test)]` invisible), and there was
no `-p mycelium-core` test job — every *companion* crate had one, core didn't. So the whole substrate
suite (codec/framing/hlc/store/swim, 131 tests), including the wire back-compat tests, was unenforced.
Same class of gap as the decoder mini-fuzz that sat uncaught until M2 Run-20. Now in the CI `Test`
job + `make check-full`.

**Input-fuzz gate (no panic on untrusted input).** The most-repeated bug family across the 2026-07-15
audit series (`docs/analysis/ratings.md`, Runs 50–58) is a *peer- or operator-supplied numeric value*
— a SWIM incarnation, an `is_fresh` interval, an `hlc`/`offset`/rate aggregate, a `fill_ratio`, a live
`TimingIntent` — put through unchecked `+`/`*`/`<<` that overflows → panics (debug/CI; kills the task or
node) or wraps (release; a silent-divergence / limiter-bypass class). **Invariant: arithmetic on any
untrusted (gossiped or config) value must be `saturating`/`checked`/`clamp`ed.** The structural gate is
a suite of proptests that run **under overflow-checks in `cargo test`**, so an unguarded op fails the
build: `store::prop_tests::fuzz_apply_observe_tick_never_panics`,
`config::config_fuzz::fuzz_validate_never_panics`, `capability::tests::fuzz_is_fresh_never_panics`,
`rate::tests::fuzz_reconcile_throttle_never_panics`, `hlc::prop_tests::observe_then_tick_never_wraps`,
`swim_membership::tests::fuzz_apply_never_panics_on_arbitrary_update` — plus the nightly cargo-fuzz
`frame_apply` decode→process target. It is **not yet comprehensive** (rate/opacity/timing internals were
only added in pass 5, after a fifth audit pass found the un-fuzzed `rate.rs` overflow) — the Robustness
dimension in `ratings.md` stays at its floor until a pass validates the sweep by finding nothing.

**Wire back-compat gate.** `codec::tests::decode_wire_v11_agrees_with_v12_on_every_shared_variant`
proves the current decoder reads a **PREV-version (v11)** frame for every shared `WireMessage` variant
— the rolling-upgrade contract (`StateRequest`'s deliberate Merkle-digest change is covered separately
by `decode_wire_v11_downgrades_state_request`). **Corpus discipline** on a `WIRE_VERSION` bump:
regenerate `GOLDENS`, freeze the *outgoing* version's bytes as `V{N}_*` fixtures, add a
`decode_wire_v{N}`, and extend the gate so new code still decodes vN frames. A live two-binary
mixed-version *cluster* test remains a documented (unbuilt) nightly-tier follow-up.

## Coop demos: wasm is opt-in (fast non-wasm builds)

`examples/coop` gates `mycelium-wasm-host` (→ wasmtime/cranelift) behind a `wasm` feature. Four
bins need it (`required-features = ["wasm"]`): `provisioning`, `catalog`, `mcp_toolgrowth`, and
the manual `model_deploy`; the other demos — e.g. `cargo run --bin diagnostics` — build
**without** compiling wasmtime. `ci_smoke.sh` enables `--features wasm` for the three CI demos
that need it; a dev iterating on any non-wasm demo skips the heavy build entirely.

CI additionally gates `tsc --noEmit` (mycelium-ts), the AFN smoke (pull+push), the coop
smoke, time-boxed fuzz (skipped on PRs), and `cargo audit` (RUSTSEC). **Don't trust a
memorised test count** — the counts grow every PR; run the suites for the live total (the
CLAUDE.md count bullet drifted twice before this rule).

## Toolchain is pinned — bump it deliberately

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins `channel = "1.96.0"` (was floating `stable`), and the CI jobs pin
`dtolnay/rust-toolchain@1.96.0` (the fuzz job stays on `@nightly` by necessity). This exists
because a new stable ships new clippy lints that redden `-D warnings` on unrelated PRs the
moment a runner picks up a newer stable than a dev has locally — it bit twice in one session
(`int_plus_one`, `manual_is_multiple_of`; analysis Runs 28–29). To upgrade: bump the file
**and** the 10 CI `@1.96.0` refs together, in their own PR, after running the full
`-D warnings` matrix on the new version — never let it float again.

## Multi-node consensus tests need listeners everywhere

`cluster_propose`/`consistent_set` compute quorum from live peers; peers without
`start_consensus_listener` never vote and every ballot times out. A test omitting this
passes only via accidental single-node quorum. Pattern (and the peer-ready poll) in
`src/lib_tests.rs::consensus_pair`.

## Structural polling, not fixed sleeps

Assert cluster state with a predicate poll (`poll_until(|| !a.peers().is_empty(), …)`), not
`sleep(300ms)`. A fixed sleep passes by luck on fast machines and hides the race on slow
ones; the structural poll converts a timing race into a deterministic failure.

The dual of that rule: **verify a new concurrency regression test against the broken code
before trusting it.** A timing-shaped test can pass on the bug it was written to catch — the
2026-09-02 pool-eviction gate's first draft (two threads + a start barrier) passed on the
pre-fix code because the barrier synchronized both first borrows past the buggy path, and even
a staggered start self-damped under real scheduling. The reliable gate asserted the *rule*
deterministically (drive two `asyncio.new_event_loop()`s and check which entries survive a
miss) rather than hoping timing exposes its violation
([.log entry](../.log/2026-09-02-360-review-fixes.md)).

## Env-var tests serialise on a lock

`apply_env_overrides` reads **all** `GOSSIP_*` vars, so any test that mutates one races
every other env test in parallel threads. Hold `config::tests::env_test_lock()` for the
guard's lifetime (added Run 28 after exactly this race).

## Ports

Use `crate::test_util::alloc_port` (process-unique, bind-verified, confined below the OS
ephemeral floor — PR #110 retired the parallel-suite flake family). Never hardcode.

## Loom: permutation model-checking of the atomic patterns

Deterministic unit tests and stress loops surface a lock-free bug only by luck — the buggy
interleaving is a narrow window. The `loom-spike` crate model-checks the project's recurring
"act on a stale read" bug family (the one the calibration ledger keeps re-recording) by
exhaustively exploring **every** thread interleaving and weak-memory execution, turning a
probabilistic race into a deterministic, reproducible failure with a printed schedule.

**Why a sibling crate.** `--cfg loom` is global to a build, and tokio gates its `net`/`fs`
modules behind `#![cfg(not(loom))]`, so any tokio-linked crate (`mycelium-core`, `mycelium`)
fails to compile under it. `loom-spike` is deliberately tokio-/papaya-/mycelium-free so loom
can actually run; the models re-implement the pattern with loom's instrumented atomics
(production code is intentionally NOT retrofitted — it isn't loom-instrumentable). Without
`--cfg loom` the crate compiles to an empty crate with zero dependencies, so it is invisible
to a normal `cargo build`/`test`.

**Patterns modelled** (`loom-spike/tests/`, each `#![cfg(loom)]`, each citing the real code):
- `once_guard.rs` — the exactly-once `AtomicBool` init guard (`FilterOpacityRegistry::spawned`
  `swap`/CAS; `capability_handle.rs:265`).
- `unique_id.rs` — the monotonic `fetch_add` unique-ID allocator (`next_pred_watcher_id`;
  `mycelium-core/src/ops.rs:237`, `kv_handle.rs:183`).
- `publish.rs` — publish-then-observe release/acquire (`soft_state_advertised.store(true,
  Release)` at `kv_persist.rs:57` paired with the `Acquire` load in `is_ready()`,
  `introspect.rs:125`). loom's weak-memory model **does** surface the all-`Relaxed` variant:
  the reader sees the flag set while reading stale data.

**Run it:**

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test -p loom-spike --release   # CI's `loom:` job (LOOM_MAX_PREEMPTIONS: 3)
```

This runs only the CORRECT tests, which pass — so the `loom:` CI job is green. Each model also
ships a `#[ignore]`d **broken twin** (a `load`-then-`store` allocator, an all-`Relaxed`
publish) kept as **executable proof loom catches the race**: run one with `-- --ignored` and it
FAILS with the offending schedule. `#[ignore]` keeps the default run green while the bug-catch
stays one command away.

## The CI flake tier (structural, Run-38 floor fix)

Socket-binding / multi-node suites run in CI through `scripts/ci-retest.sh`, not bare
`cargo test`: on failure the wrapper re-runs **only the failed tests, individually, once**. A
test that fails twice is a real failure and reds the build; a test that passes on isolated
retry keeps the build green **but emits a loud per-test flake annotation + step-summary line**.
The policy that makes this safe against the Run-37 masking failure mode: **a flake annotation
is a bug report** — recurring annotations get a root-cause dig (the wiki port race and the
opacity shed bug were both found that way), and "fixing" a flake by widening a timeout is
forbidden. Deterministic unit gates stay on bare `cargo test`. This is the class-level
prevention Run 37 asked for: a wall-clock flake can no longer red main *or* hide silently.

Companion integration tests now reach the same allocator: `alloc_port` is exposed under the
core's `test-util` cargo feature (Run-39 floor fix), and every companion with a real-agent
`tests/` suite pulls `mycelium = { path = "..", features = ["test-util"] }` as a **dev-dependency**
and calls `mycelium::test_util::alloc_port()` in place of its old `free_port()`. That is the
class-level prevention — the bind-`:0`-read-drop idiom is gone from the `tests/` surface, so no
companion re-opens the TOCTOU window (only the `examples/` `free_port` remain, a follow-up).

The bind retry stays as defense-in-depth for the residual case — an agent under test binds a port
`alloc_port` returned but a foreign process grabbed it first: **retry the bind, never bare-`unwrap`
it**. The old bind-`:0`-read-drop idiom (`free_port()`) opened a TOCTOU window against parallel
test binaries (`AddrInUse` flaked `mycelium-wiki/tests/failover.rs` in CI, 2026-07-07). Retry at
the granularity the topology
forces: per-agent with fresh ports when nodes join one at a time (the wasm-host tests'
16-attempt loop), **per-pair** when mutual bootstrap fixes both ports before either agent
starts (`start_pair()` in the wiki tests — shut the half-started survivor down before
re-attempting, and shut a discarded `Wiki` down explicitly, the Run-32 task-leak lesson).
