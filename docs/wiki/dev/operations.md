# dev/operations — the diagnostic surface

↑ [dev/](dev.md) · operator runbooks: `docs/operations/` (deployment, observability, tuning, dynamic-scaling…). Before a go-live, the [`production-readiness.md`](../../operations/production-readiness.md) pre-flight ties the topic runbooks into one sweep; for a first customer engagement, [`customer-pilot.md`](../../operations/customer-pilot.md) scopes it as external validation.

## Node-level HTTP endpoints (`gateway` feature)

The four probes are **public by design** (M16 edge criterion — what a balancer or scraper needs with no credential); `/consensus/{slot}` sits behind the gateway bearer when a token model is set (2026-09-05, with `/mcp` and `/signals/{kind}` — [security](security.md) §3). The whole public surface is the probes, `/bulk/{id}` (nonce-capability URL) and the A2A descriptor — `docs/operations/rbac.md`.

| Endpoint | Tells you |
|---|---|
| `GET /health` | process alive |
| `GET /ready` | startup complete → serving KV/signals/membership (capability discovery gossips independently and does **not** gate readiness — a node advertising no soft state is still ready; changed 2026-07-15) |
| `GET /stats` | `node_id`, optional `cluster_name` (`GOSSIP_CLUSTER_NAME` — also a `cluster` global label on `/metrics` and an AgentFacts field), `store_entries`, `dropped_frames`, `task_count`, the tripwire counters (`commit_conflicts`, `sys_namespace_violations`, `cap_authz_violations`, `schema_mismatch`, `rate_limited_senders`, `individual_flood_fallbacks` — the flood-fallback/topology-pressure signal, remedy `connect_peer` — and `identity_anchor_conflicts` — a `sys/identity` KV key differing from a directly-connected peer's CA-anchored mTLS key; identity-poisoning signal, WS-E Phase 1b), the liveness fields (`dead_shards`, `gc_alive`, `health_monitor_alive`), the emergent-detector gauges `governed_group_conflicts` (P1) and `capability_coverage_gaps` (P6), `membership_flaps` (P2), `opacity_oscillations` (P3 — (node,kind) pairs hunting in/out of shed) (Legible-Emergence Phase 1; `0` unless `GOSSIP_EMERGENT_DETECTORS`), and — when detectors are enabled — `opaque_node_pct` (P4 fleet-opacity-storm gauge, 0–100; a raw gauge the operator thresholds) plus a `view_confidence` object (RT1/RT2: a per-node *estimate*, not fleet truth; `peers_heard`/`peers_known`, `max_staleness_ms`, `self_degraded`) |
| `GET /consensus/{slot}` | committed value (lease-aware) + ballot + lease state — **bearer-gated** when a token model is set (`consensus:read`, 2026-09-05) |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus (`metrics` feature). Includes the emergent-detector gauges when `GOSSIP_EMERGENT_DETECTORS` is on: `mycelium_emergent_governed_group_conflicts` (P1), `mycelium_emergent_capability_coverage_gaps` (P6), `mycelium_emergent_membership_flaps` (P2), `mycelium_emergent_opacity_oscillations` (P3), `mycelium_emergent_opaque_node_pct` (P4), and the RT1/RT2 view-health gauges `mycelium_emergent_peers_heard` / `_peers_known` / `_max_staleness_ms` (alert-qualify a diagnostic by the observer's own view: `peers_heard` ≪ `peers_known` ⇒ partial view). Plus the **consensus/lock** family (needs `consensus`): `mycelium_consensus_timeouts_total{reason}` (event-emitted at every no-quorum exit — `no_voters`=partition / `quorum_short`=overload / `all_opaque` / `empty_groups`; the one series *not* gated on the detector loop) and `mycelium_consensus_commit_conflicts` / `mycelium_schema_mismatch` (gauges mirroring the `/stats` scalars, set on the detector tick). Locks are consensus slots → no per-lock gauge; inspect one via `GET /consensus/lock/{name}` |

Diagnostics surface (Legible Emergence, all `fleet:read`) — the three-verb operator spine, each
computed locally from this node's gossiped KV (coordinator-free: any node answers; at convergence
the *diagnosis* agrees across nodes, while each keeps its own `view_confidence`):

- **localize** — `GET /gateway/fleet`: the relational snapshot (governed-group status, coverage
  gaps, opacity, throttle graph, cross-node store-convergence, commit-conflict hot slots + the
  RT1/RT2 `view_confidence` header).
- **explain** — `GET /gateway/explain?since=`: the cross-node HLC-ordered event narrative,
  best-effort fan-out (**capped** at `EXPLAIN_MAX_FANOUT` peers so an operator query never becomes an
  O(N) RPC storm) that *names* both the peers that did not answer (`non_responders`) and the count
  skipped by the cap (`not_queried`) rather than silently dropping them (RT3).
- **diagnose** — `GET /gateway/diagnose`: the "why is the fleet in this state" rule engine — a
  most-severe-first list of findings, each naming a pathology in actionable terms, with an RT1/RT2
  `caveat` when the observer's own view is partial.

All three are also programmatic (**diagnostics as data**): `agent.fleet_snapshot()` /
`fleet_diagnosis()`. Operator runbook (one entry per pathology + Prometheus alert recipes):
[operations/diagnostics.md](../../operations/diagnostics.md).

Governance surface: `POST /gateway/govern/{timing,tuning,membership}` + `GET /gateway/govern`
(deny-by-default scopes, WS2-audited) — see
[management-as-intent](../domain/theory/management-as-intent.md) for the model.

**Identity / key revocation (SOC 2 WS-B, `compliance`):** `POST /gateway/identity/revoke` (scope
`identity:write`), body `{"revoked_key":"<64 hex>","reason":"…"}` — the operator compromise-
remediation trigger. Revocations are validated + excluded on all verify paths incl. consensus
(`src/agent/revocation.rs`); rotate then revoke, or `rotate_identity_on_compromise`. Runbook:
[cert-rotation](../../operations/cert-rotation.md).

**Native gateway TLS (WS-A):** the gateway is plaintext by default (the "no auth by design" edge
above is the *default*, not a ceiling — set `gateway_scoped_tokens`/OIDC for auth). Set
`GossipConfig::gateway_tls` (`GatewayTlsConfig`) for native server-side HTTPS so bearer tokens/JWTs
are never cleartext — reuse the node cert or supply a hostname cert.
[gateway-tls](../../operations/gateway-tls.md).

**Authenticated identity (WS-E):** every TLS node publishes a signed `sys/identity-proof/{self}`;
peers reject an identity overwrite whose proof doesn't chain to a trusted key (`identity_anchor_conflicts`
counts rejections, on `/stats`). `require_identity_proofs` (`GOSSIP_REQUIRE_IDENTITY_PROOFS`, default
off) also rejects *unsigned* entries — enable only after full fleet rollout (two-release discipline,
[cert-rotation](../../operations/cert-rotation.md)).

**Bridged capability adverts need a lease.** `POST /gateway/capability/advertise` spawns the
refresh loop *in the node*, so a bridge client's advert survives the client's crash and never
evaporates (the 2026-07-20 scraper-fleet "stale w15 advert" finding: provider liveness decoupled
from refresher liveness). Pass `lease_secs` and beat `POST /gateway/capability/{handle_id}/heartbeat`
within every window (beat at `lease_secs/3`); a missed window retracts exactly as DELETE would.
Omitting `lease_secs` keeps the old durable-until-DELETE semantics — correct only when the
advertised capability's lifetime really is the node's. Canon: `src/agent/http.rs`
(`gw_cap_advertise`); both SDK bridges expose it (`leaseSecs` + `handle.heartbeat()` in
`mycelium-ts`, `lease_secs` + `handle.heartbeat()` in `mycelium-py`).

## task_count reference (leak triage)

Steady state after `start()`: 7 core loops (GC, health, anti-entropy, WAL-flush, reorder
buffer, capability heartbeat, group-member sync) + 2 per gossip shard (default 4) + 1
gateway + N per-peer writers + N `bulk_serve` listeners. Typical 3-node baseline **17–20**.
Not tracked: `rpc_call` (no task), `scatter_gather` (local JoinSet), per-request bulk
handlers (semaphore-bounded, visible as `active_bulk_handlers`). Unbounded growth ⇒ suspect
a per-peer writer not exiting on disconnect.

## Feature gates

`cli` (default; tracing-subscriber for binaries) · `gateway` (default; disable for embedded: `default-features = false` — gossip, KV, signals,
consensus, typed handles all remain) · `consensus` (default; drop for minimal embeds — a
consensus-free node still *forwards* PROPOSE/VOTE/COMMIT) · `tls` · `metrics` · `a2a` ·
`llm` · `otel` (OTEL span export from `SkillRunner`) · `compliance` (= gateway+tls).
`mycelium-core` builds standalone (≈48 deps vs ≈140). (`fuzz-internals` / `test-util` are
test-only, deliberately not listed here.)

## Framing discipline

Mycelium is a **library, not a platform** — no daemon, no control plane; a cluster is
emergent from network reachability; fleet observability is the operator's stack aggregating
per-node `/metrics` ([deployment-framing](../domain/strategy/deployment-framing.md)).
