# Mycelium FAQ — start here

The rest of this guide is deep reference. This page is the **first read**: short
answers that point you at the one doc or example you actually need. If a question
here doesn't route you well, that's a docs bug — open an issue.

## Is Mycelium for me?

Mycelium earns its keep when you have **many agents (or nodes) that must
coordinate, and you don't want a coordinator** — no broker, no scheduler, no
control plane to run or scale or fail. State converges by gossip; work is claimed,
not dispatched; roles are discovered, not assigned. It embeds as a Rust library
inside your process — there is no daemon.

It is **probably overkill** if you just want to chain a few LLM calls, run one
orchestrator that fans out to workers, or coordinate through a database or queue
you already operate. Reach for a workflow engine (LangGraph, Temporal) or a broker
(NATS, Kafka) there — see *[Why not X?](#why-not-langgraph--temporal--nats--)* below.

The sweet spot: coordination **at scale, without a single point of control** —
fleets that partition and heal, edge/on-prem meshes, systems where "who is in
charge" must be emergent and recallable. The rationale is in
[`philosophy.md`](../philosophy.md) and [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md)
("The Structural Inversion").

## Which primitive or companion do I want?

Everything is built on the `mycelium-core` substrate (KV + signals + consensus).
The companions are opinionated coordination patterns on top of the **public API**
— pick by the shape of your problem:

| Your problem | Use | Start with |
|---|---|---|
| Shared eventually-consistent state, events, opt-in quorum agreement | **core substrate** | [`three_node_demo`](../../README.md#run) · guide [01](01-gossip-kv.md)/[03](03-signals.md)/[04](04-consensus.md) |
| Stage-by-stage work handoff, pull-based pipelines | **tuple-space** (position/coordination) | [`redistribution.rs`](../../mycelium-tuple-space/examples/redistribution.rs) · guide [07](07-pipelines.md) |
| One shared pool of facts many agents read & refine | **blackboard** (content) | [`microgrid.rs`](../../mycelium-blackboard/examples/microgrid.rs) |
| Durable, curated, queryable memory the fleet grounds on | **wiki** | [`wiki_chat.rs`](../../mycelium-wiki/examples/wiki_chat.rs) |
| Ship code/policy to where the data is | **wasm-host** (code mobility) | [`mycelium-wasm-host`](../../mycelium-wasm-host/README.md) |
| Cross-fleet identity & capability federation | **agentfacts** | [`mycelium-agentfacts`](../../mycelium-agentfacts/README.md) |
| LLM agents that self-organise by meaning, not addresses | **semantic coordination** | [`semantic_coordination.rs`](../../examples/semantic_coordination.rs) · guide [11](11-semantic-coordination.md) |

Two `mycelium` vs `mycelium-core` crate-choice questions are answered in the
[README](../../README.md#which-crate--mycelium-vs-mycelium-core).

Building your *own* coordinated service (a fourth companion)? The choice underneath these — a
capability-ring single-writer vs the consensus-backed distributed lock, and why the three companions
all pick the ring — is the [coordination-approaches design note](../design/coordination-approaches.md).

---

## Where do I start — hello world?

1. **`cargo run --example hello_mesh`** — two agents share a value by gossip, no setup, no LLM.
   Read the ~25 lines ([`examples/hello_mesh.rs`](../../examples/hello_mesh.rs)): that's the whole
   Layer-I substrate everything else builds on.
2. Read guide [00-concepts.md](00-concepts.md) for the three-layer model and the
   sub-handle API (`kv()`, `mesh()`, `capabilities()`, `consensus()`).
3. Skim a runnable example close to your problem from the table above.

For an interactive two-node REPL (`set`/`get` keys by hand) see the README
[Run](../../README.md#run) section.

**Building a use case *on top* of Mycelium** (a coordinator, an agent fleet, your
own companion crate)? Go to **[Building on Mycelium](building-on-mycelium.md)** — the
integrator contract: the dependency, the public-API-only rule, which KV prefixes to
avoid, the invariants you must respect, and a copyable `CLAUDE.md` snippet for your
own agent-driven project.

## Which example maps to my problem?

| I want to see… | Example |
|---|---|
| A real gossip mesh doing visible work | [`conway.rs`](../../examples/conway.rs) (Game of Life on a 16×16 mesh) |
| An LLM agent using tools + skills over the mesh | [`llm_agent.rs`](../../examples/llm_agent.rs), [`three_node_demo.rs`](../../examples/three_node_demo.rs) |
| Invoking a named skill hosted on another node | [`invoke_skill.rs`](../../examples/invoke_skill.rs) |
| Agents self-organising by meaning | [`semantic_coordination.rs`](../../examples/semantic_coordination.rs) |
| **Proof** the coordination is really coordinator-free | [`coordinator_comparison.rs`](../../examples/coordinator_comparison.rs), [`three_arm_workdist.rs`](../../examples/three_arm_workdist.rs) |
| A full companion worked example | [`redistribution.rs`](../../mycelium-tuple-space/examples/redistribution.rs) (tuple-space), [`microgrid.rs`](../../mycelium-blackboard/examples/microgrid.rs) (blackboard), [`wiki_chat.rs`](../../mycelium-wiki/examples/wiki_chat.rs) (wiki) |

## Why not LangGraph / Temporal / NATS / …?

Short version — Mycelium is a **substrate**, not a framework, and the distinction
is the coordinator:

- **LangGraph / AutoGen** — great for a *defined* graph of steps driven by one
  process. Mycelium has no central graph: topology is emergent and survives the
  loss of any node, including "the orchestrator." *You don't have to choose: you can
  run a LangGraph graph **on** Mycelium — the [langgraph ladder](../../examples/langgraph/)
  does, and its **deploy/reheal** rung shows a graph's reasoning surviving the death of
  the mesh node it ran against, resuming on a peer — the claim above, demonstrated.*
- **Temporal / durable workflow engines** — give you a durable *scheduler you
  operate*. Mycelium removes the scheduler; there is nothing central to run.
- **NATS / Kafka / a broker** — a broker *is* the coordinator: a separate process
  you provision, scale, and monitor, and a single point of failure everything routes
  through (when it degrades, so does every producer and consumer). Mycelium's mesh is
  the bus, registry, and scheduler at once, with no broker process to run.
- **Erlang/OTP, Akka** — closest in spirit (supervision, location transparency),
  but still a managed cluster with explicit process addressing. Mycelium adds
  receiver-side signal boundaries, gossip-convergent state, and roles discovered
  by capability rather than addressed by PID.

If your problem *has* a natural coordinator and you're happy running it, one of
the above is likely the simpler choice. Mycelium is for when you specifically
don't want that dependency.

## Common gotchas

- **Call `shutdown()`.** Companions with background curators/loops (e.g. the wiki)
  hold task cycles; drop alone won't stop them. See
  [14-patterns-and-pitfalls.md](14-patterns-and-pitfalls.md).
- **The gateway has no auth by default.** The HTTP gateway is for trusted networks
  unless you put mTLS / a proxy in front — see guide [09-security.md](09-security.md)
  and [operations](../operations/README.md).
- **Rolling upgrades are wire-version gated.** One version step per rollout
  (`WIRE_VERSION`/`PREV_WIRE_VERSION`); mixed clusters spanning two steps won't
  talk. See guide [13-cluster-topology.md](13-cluster-topology.md).
- **Opacity/load is emergent, not commanded.** You don't "mark a node down"; nodes
  advertise load and peers route around it. See [00-concepts.md](00-concepts.md).
- **Consistency is opt-in.** `kv()` is eventually consistent; reach for
  `consensus()` only where you actually need linearisability (guide
  [04-consensus.md](04-consensus.md)).

More failure modes: [14-patterns-and-pitfalls.md](14-patterns-and-pitfalls.md) and
[error-handling.md](error-handling.md).

## How do I build, test, and run?

- **Build:** `cargo build --release` (a `--no-default-features` build drops the
  gateway; see [Cargo features](../../README.md)).
- **Pre-push gate:** `make check` (clippy across the CI feature matrix, ~3 min);
  `make check-full` adds the test suites.
- **Run a mesh:** README [Run](../../README.md#run) section.
- **Task recipes** ("how do I do X?"): [cookbook.md](cookbook.md).
