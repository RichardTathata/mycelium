# 01 — Gossip KV: shared state without a broker

## Concept

Most distributed systems assume a coordinator: a Kafka broker, a Redis server,
an etcd cluster. Mycelium's KV store has none. Every node holds a full replica
of the cluster state. Writes propagate by epidemic gossip — each node
periodically fans out updates to a random subset of peers; within a few
round-trip times every node has converged.

**Last-write-wins with causal ordering.** Each value is tagged with a Hybrid
Logical Clock (HLC) timestamp that combines wall-clock time with a logical
counter. Under clock skew the HLC guarantees that any write *after* observing
a remote value has a strictly greater timestamp — so "last write" is "causally
last", not just "physically last".

**TTL-native cleanup.** Every key has a time-to-live. Expired keys are
purged on read and during anti-entropy sync. This means heartbeats, capability
advertisements, and work claims self-clean without a garbage-collection job.

    participant A as Node A
    participant B as Node B
    participant C as Node C

    A->>A: set("grid/5/alive", true)<br/>HLC tick → ts=1001
    A->>B: gossip push (key, value, ts=1001)
    A->>C: gossip push (key, value, ts=1001)
    B->>B: apply_and_notify — ts=1001 > local → accept
    C->>C: apply_and_notify — ts=1001 > local → accept
    Note over A,C: All three nodes converge.<br/>Anti-entropy catches any missed updates.
```

**Anti-entropy.** On reconnect, or on a configurable interval, each node
compares its state digest with a peer's and requests any missing keys. This
means brief network partitions heal automatically — nodes that were isolated
converge as soon as they reconnect.

## The Example

**Conway's Game of Life on a 16×16 gossip mesh** — 256 `GossipAgent` instances
run in-process over TCP. Each agent owns one cell. Cell state lives in the KV
store and propagates epidemically. A local timer drives each agent's generation
tick, demonstrating the separation of concerns: gossip handles state
propagation; local timers handle coordination.

**Prerequisites**

```bash
cargo build --example conway
```

**Run**

```bash
cargo run --example conway
# Then open: http://localhost:8090  → switch to "Live (Rust)"
```

**Expected output**

```
conway: raising fd limit to 4096
conway: spawning 256 agents on ports 52000-52255...
conway: all agents started, settling for 3s...
conway: HTTP server listening on :8090
conway: generation loop started
```

The browser shows a 16×16 grid updating every ~300 ms. The glider pattern in
the top-left corner propagates across the toroidal grid.

**What to observe**

- Open the browser during the 3-second settle phase: cells will be
  inconsistent. After settle, the grid converges and generations are clean.
- Resize the window to `Terminal` view to see raw KV churn in the logs.
- Kill and restart `cargo run --example conway` — the grid resets because
  each run uses fresh in-memory state (no persistence configured).

---

## How It Works

`examples/conway.rs:48–60` defines the grid constants. Each agent is created
with a standard `GossipConfig`:

```rust
// conway.rs — one agent per cell
let mut cfg = GossipConfig::default();
cfg.bind_port  = BASE_PORT + idx as u16;
cfg.bootstrap_peers = neighbours(idx)  // 4 cardinal neighbours
    .map(|n| NodeId::new("127.0.0.1", BASE_PORT + n as u16))
    .collect();

let agent = Arc::new(GossipAgent::new(node_id, cfg));
agent.start().await?;
```

The cell key is `grid/{row}/{col}`. Each generation tick:

```rust
// Read neighbour states from local KV (no network call)
let live_neighbours = neighbour_coords(row, col).iter()
    .filter(|(r, c)| agent.kv().get(&format!("grid/{r}/{c}"))
        .map(|b| b.as_ref() == b"1")
        .unwrap_or(false))
    .count();

// Apply Conway rules and write own cell
let next = conway_rule(was_alive, live_neighbours);
agent.kv().set(&format!("grid/{row}/{col}"), Bytes::from(if next { "1" } else { "0" }));
```

`agent.kv().get()` reads from the local in-memory store — no network hop. The
gossip layer ensures that store is a recent replica of the full mesh state.

## Dev Notes

**Key namespace design.** All application keys should live under a meaningful
prefix. The KV store is shared across all layers; the namespace table in
`src/lib.rs` documents which prefixes are owned by the library itself. Your
keys should use application-specific prefixes (`app/`, `pipeline/`, `jobs/`).
Avoid `sys/`, `cap/`, `grp/`, `consensus/` — those are library-owned.

**TTL sizing.** The `set` family accepts an optional TTL. Leave it `None` for
durable state. For ephemeral state (heartbeats, work claims, presence) use a
TTL that is comfortably longer than your refresh interval — 3–5× is a good
rule of thumb. Too short and a slow node loses its claim before it finishes.

**`scan_prefix` for bulk reads.** Rather than reading keys one by one, use:

```rust
let cells = agent.kv().scan_prefix("grid/");
// returns Vec<(String, Bytes)> — all keys under prefix, from local store
```

**Persistence across restarts.** By default the KV store is in-memory. To
survive an unclean shutdown, configure a WAL:

```rust
cfg.persistence = Some(PersistenceConfig {
    base_path:              PathBuf::from("/var/lib/mynode"),   // data lands in {base_path}/{node_id}/kv/
    sync_mode:              SyncMode::Flush,   // fdatasync per write (~1 ms on SSD); Async = OS-buffered
    snapshot_wal_threshold: 10_000,            // compact the WAL into a snapshot every N records …
    snapshot_interval_secs: 300,               // … or every 5 min, whichever first
});
```

What an acknowledged write means depends on `sync_mode`: `Flush` — `set_async` returns after the
record is on stable storage (a dead WAL writer or disk error surfaces as the append's `Err`, never a
silent `Ok`); `Async` (the default) — OS-buffered, the last few writes may be lost on power failure;
`Os` — no explicit sync, development only. Consensus committed slots and leases are fsynced in
**every** mode. A snapshot never discards a WAL record (it merges the WAL tail before truncating),
and replay is last-writer-wins over every record — the same rule the live store applies. Operator
side: [deployment.md § Persistence modes](../operations/deployment.md#persistence-modes).

**The KV ring as pipeline buffer.** The fluid pipeline example
([07-pipelines.md](07-pipelines.md)) uses `scan_prefix("pipeline/stage-a/")`
as a distributed work queue. Each item is a KV entry; workers claim items by
writing a claim key with a short TTL; the coordinator drains and routes. No
separate queue infrastructure needed.

**When NOT to use KV for events.** KV is durable-ish shared state. For
ephemeral fan-out events — notifications, triggers, real-time signals — use
the Signal Mesh ([03-signals.md](03-signals.md)) instead. The signal layer
is zero-copy, has no persistence overhead, and is built for high-frequency
fan-out.

**Just need this layer? Depend on `mycelium-core`.** Everything in this
chapter (the gossip KV store) and the signal mesh ([03-signals.md](03-signals.md))
live in the standalone [`mycelium-core`](../../mycelium-core/) crate — Layers I + II
with no Axum/gateway and roughly a third of the full dependency tree. If your
embed needs last-write-wins KV propagation and scoped events but not RPC,
consensus, the capability system, or the HTTP gateway, depend on `mycelium-core`
directly instead of `mycelium`. The full `mycelium` crate re-exports it, so the
API is identical. See the README's *Which crate?* section and ROADMAP §v2.0 M1.

## Reference — Layer I API & observability

*Moved from the repo README (2026-07-10) — the front page now links here; this is the single home.*

```rust
use mycelium::{GossipAgent, GossipConfig, NodeId};
use std::sync::Arc;

let mut config = GossipConfig::default();
config.bootstrap_peers = vec!["127.0.0.1:7947".parse()?];

let agent = Arc::new(GossipAgent::new(NodeId::new("127.0.0.1", 7946)?, config));
agent.start().await?;

// Write — local store always updated; returns false if gossip channel full
agent.kv().set("key", Bytes::from("value"));

// Read
if let Some(bytes) = agent.kv().get("key") { /* ... */ }

// Delete (propagates a tombstone)
agent.kv().delete("key");

// Enumerate live keys
let keys: Vec<Arc<str>> = agent.kv().keys();

// Scan by prefix — capability discovery, pheromone trail reads
let entries = agent.kv().scan_prefix("load/");

// Subscribe — watch::Receiver fires on every change (local or gossiped)
let mut rx = agent.kv().subscribe("load/my-node");
rx.changed().await?;
println!("{:?}", *rx.borrow());  // None = tombstoned; Some(bytes) = current value

agent.shutdown().await;
```

#### Layer I Observability

`system_stats()` is the primary diagnostic surface. Poll it periodically or on anomalies:

```rust
let stats = agent.system_stats();

// Propagation health — the most important number.
// dropped_frames > 0 means gossip writes were silently lost.
// Cause: writer_channel_depth or gossip_channel_capacity too small for the burst rate.
// Fix: raise the limiting field (documented sizing formula in GossipConfig).
assert_eq!(stats.dropped_frames, 0);

// Topology
println!("peers: {}", stats.peers);             // live peers in the ping table
println!("store: {}", stats.store_entries);     // live KV entries (tombstones excluded)

// Internal health — alert if false while agent is running
assert!(stats.gc_alive);                        // tombstone expiry and subscription cleanup
assert!(stats.health_monitor_alive);            // peer pings and eviction

// Shard backpressure — non-zero means gossip workers are falling behind
println!("shard depths: {:?}", stats.gossip_shard_queue_depths);
println!("dead shards: {}", stats.dead_shards); // should always be 0
```

**Diagnostic flow when writes stop propagating:**

```
dropped_frames > 0?
  YES → writer_channel_depth or gossip_channel_capacity too small
        Size writer_channel_depth to N_agents × fan_out (default fan_out = 4)
  NO  → peers == 0?  bootstrap_peers misconfigured or all peers unreachable
        health_monitor_alive == false?  internal task failure — restart agent
        shard_queue_depths saturated?   gossip_shards too low for write rate
```

**Topology introspection — is the store visible from the outside?**

`scan_prefix` doubles as a topology query. After the cluster settles, every node's pheromone
trail is visible from every other node via anti-entropy sync:

```rust
// Count live workers in the "nlp" pool
let live_workers: Vec<LoadState> = agent.kv().scan_prefix("load/nlp/")
    .into_iter()
    .filter_map(|(_, b)| decode::<LoadState>(&b))
    .filter(|s| unix_ms_now() - s.written_at_ms < 30_000)  // evaporation window
    .collect();
println!("{} live nlp workers", live_workers.len());
```
