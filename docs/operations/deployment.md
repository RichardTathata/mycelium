# Deploying Mycelium

**Mycelium is a library, not a platform.** There is no daemon, control plane,
installer, or orchestrator to deploy. You embed the library in your process and
call `GossipAgent::start()`; that process *is* a full mesh node. "Deploying
Mycelium" means deploying *your* binary that embeds it.

> Audience: **DevOps**. The developer-side "how do I embed it" is in the
> [cookbook](../guide/cookbook.md).

## The minimum

```rust
let node = NodeId::new("0.0.0.0", 7946)?;
let mut cfg = GossipConfig::default();
cfg.bind_port = 7946;                                  // gossip (TCP)
cfg.bootstrap_peers = vec![NodeId::new("seed.internal", 7946)?];
let agent = Arc::new(GossipAgent::new(node, cfg));
agent.start().await?;
```

A node needs: a **gossip port** and at least one **bootstrap peer** to find the
mesh (a seed needs none). Everything else is optional.

## Ports

| Config | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `bind_port` | gossip transport (TCP, and SWIM UDP if enabled) — node-to-node | required |
| `http_port` | the embedded gateway (diagnostics, AgentFacts, `/gateway/*`) | `None` (off) |
| `http_addr` | interface the gateway binds | `127.0.0.1` |

`http_port` must differ from `bind_port`. Leave `http_port = None` for a
headless node; set it (and `http_addr = "0.0.0.0"`) to expose the gateway. See
[observability.md](observability.md) for what the gateway serves.

## Seeds & bootstrapping

There is no special "master." A **seed** is just a node others list in their
`bootstrap_peers`; it has no extra role and can fail without electing a
replacement (peers re-bootstrap off any reachable member). Run 2–3 seeds for
redundancy and point everyone at all of them. Topology, sizing, and partition
recovery: [guide 13 · Cluster topology](../guide/13-cluster-topology.md).

## TLS / identity (recommended)

```rust
cfg.tls = Some(TlsConfig { auto_cert_dir: "/var/lib/mycelium/tls".into(), ..Default::default() });
```

With `tls` set, the node generates an Ed25519 identity + a CA-signed cert into
`auto_cert_dir` on first start, and all gossip is mTLS. **Every node in one
cluster must trust the same CA** — share the CA cert (`{auto_cert_dir}/ca-cert.pem`)
across nodes, or point them at a shared `auto_cert_dir`. The same key is the
node's identity for signed KV, consensus, audit, and AgentFacts. Rotation
without disruption: [cert-rotation.md](cert-rotation.md). Compliance features
(RBAC, audit, OIDC) build on this: [rbac.md](rbac.md), [audit.md](audit.md),
[sso.md](sso.md).

## Naming the cluster

Set `GOSSIP_CLUSTER_NAME` (or `GossipConfig::cluster_name`) to label the
environment — `prod-eu`, `staging`, … It is a pure operator label (no effect on
gossip, identity, or membership) that flows to `/stats`, the `/metrics` `cluster`
label, and AgentFacts, so one monitoring stack can tell environments apart. See
[observability.md](observability.md#naming-environments--monitoring-many-clusters).

## Containers / Compose

No special base image — it's your Rust binary. Expose `bind_port` (and
`http_port` if used), give each node a stable address its peers can reach, and
mount a volume for `auto_cert_dir` (so identity survives restarts) and for the
WAL/persistence path if enabled. Reference multi-node setups:
[`examples/community`](../../examples/community/) (skillrunner cluster) and the
`tests/integration/docker-compose.*.yml` files.

## Cloud / Kubernetes / bare metal

Mycelium ships **no Helm chart** and no opinionated, hardened product packaging — and that
is deliberate: a node is just a binary/container, and packaging would only track cloud churn
while every org's topology differs. It *does* ship **reference deployment scaffolding** to
copy and adapt: Kubernetes manifests —
[`deploy/kubernetes/`](../../deploy/kubernetes/) (`kubectl apply -k deploy/kubernetes`): a
seed StatefulSet + headless Service, a scalable worker StatefulSet, and a mgmt dashboard,
wired exactly as this section describes — and Terraform for the cluster itself —
[`deploy/terraform/`](../../deploy/terraform/) (EKS + ECR, or GKE + Artifact Registry), so
the whole path is `terraform apply` → push image → `kubectl apply -k`. Deploy it (or your
own) like any **stateful** service, minding two requirements that follow from the design:

1. **Stable network identity.** A node's `node_id` is its `host:port`; peers
   bootstrap to it by address. Each node needs an address that survives a restart
   (a static IP, a DNS name, or a Kubernetes *headless Service* + StatefulSet pod
   DNS like `node-0.gossip.svc`). Don't put gossip behind a round-robin load
   balancer — peers must reach *specific* nodes.
2. **Persistent identity + WAL.** Mount a durable volume for `auto_cert_dir` (so
   the Ed25519 identity survives restarts) and, if persistence is on, the WAL path
   (so state replays). On k8s that's a `volumeClaimTemplates` PVC per pod.

**Kubernetes:** a **StatefulSet** (stable pod identity + per-pod PVC) behind a
**headless Service** (stable per-pod DNS for bootstrap) is the natural fit; set
`GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP_PEERS` (or the demo image's `MYCELIUM_PEERS`) to a seed pod's DNS
name, `readinessProbe` → `/ready`, `livenessProbe` → `/health`, and
`GOSSIP_CLUSTER_NAME` to the environment. Scrape `/metrics` with a `ServiceMonitor`.
The ready-to-apply manifests in [`deploy/kubernetes/`](../../deploy/kubernetes/) do
exactly this — start there rather than from scratch, and see
[`deploy/terraform/`](../../deploy/terraform/) to provision the EKS/GKE cluster they run on. **AWS/GCP/bare metal:** an instance/ECS-task
per node with a stable address (Elastic IP / internal DNS) + a durable disk (EBS /
PD) for `auto_cert_dir` + WAL; a sample systemd unit is just `ExecStart=mycelium`
with the `GOSSIP_*` env in the unit's `Environment=`. Elastic membership (add/remove
nodes) is then driven by [dynamic-scaling.md](dynamic-scaling.md) — the governors
self-heal the count; the substrate needs no orchestrator hook.

## Sizing & tuning

Most defaults auto-derive from cluster size (WS-C). For large clusters or
constrained nodes, [tuning.md](tuning.md) covers `gossip_shards`,
`writer_channel_depth`, health/anti-entropy intervals, and
`GOSSIP_MAX_ACTIVE_CONNECTIONS` (the partial-mesh cap that avoids the O(N²)
connection ceiling). These can be set live — see [dynamic-scaling.md](dynamic-scaling.md).

## Restart behaviour

A restarted node re-bootstraps, re-learns the full KV state via anti-entropy,
and re-advertises its capabilities — there is no rejoin ceremony. With a
persisted `auto_cert_dir` it keeps its identity; with persistence enabled it
replays its WAL. Capability advertisements evaporate while a node is down and
reappear on restart (see [00 · Concepts](../guide/00-concepts.md) on evaporation).

### Persistence modes

`PersistenceConfig` (`base_path` · `sync_mode` · `snapshot_wal_threshold`, default 10 000 ·
`snapshot_interval_secs`, default 300) writes `{base_path}/{node_id}/kv/{wal.bin,snapshot.bin}`.
What a write acknowledgement means is the one operator decision:

| `sync_mode` | Meaning of an acked write | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `Flush` | on stable storage (`fdatasync` per record); a stopped WAL writer or disk error is an `Err`, never a silent `Ok` | ~1 ms/write on SSD |
| `Async` (default) | OS-buffered; the last few writes can be lost on power failure | none |
| `Os` | no explicit sync — development only | none |

In every mode: **consensus committed slots and leases are fsynced** (`append_sync` forces it) and
the commit result carries `persisted` (gateway JSON `"persisted"`; `false` = committed
cluster-wide but not on this node's disk — logged at `error`, repaired from peers by anti-entropy
after a restart; treat a run of `false` as a disk or writer fault on that node). A snapshot merges
the on-disk WAL tail before truncating, so it never discards a record, and the snapshot rename is
fsynced at the directory before the WAL is truncated, so a power loss cannot leave an old snapshot
beside an emptied WAL; replay is last-writer-wins over every record. **Storage assumptions:** directory
fsync honoured (ext4, XFS, btrfs — the deployment targets); on **macOS** `fsync` does not force the
drive's write cache (`F_FULLFSYNC` would), so a laptop's power-loss durability is weaker than Linux's for
every sync in the WAL, not only this one — development only. Tune `snapshot_interval_secs` / `snapshot_wal_threshold` so replay time is
bounded; the snapshot pass raises the node's opacity for its duration. Since v2.4.2
(`CHANGELOG § [2.4.2]`); the invariants are canon in `mycelium-core/src/persistence.rs`.

## Rolling upgrades

Mycelium tolerates a **mixed-version cluster** during an upgrade: `read_frame` accepts both the
current and previous wire version (`WIRE_VERSION` / `PREV_WIRE_VERSION`, currently **12 / 11** in
`src/framing.rs`). There is no cluster-wide upgrade command — it's a library, so rolling a fleet is
your orchestrator's job (restart the processes); Mycelium's contract is that the mixed window is
safe. The procedure:

1. **One wire step per rollout.** Nodes one wire version apart interoperate; **two apart do not**. If
   a release bumps `WIRE_VERSION`, get the whole fleet onto it before the next bump. Most releases
   don't touch the wire — when `PREV_WIRE_VERSION == WIRE_VERSION` there is no live window and any
   order is safe.
2. **Upgrade node-by-node.** Replace one node's binary and restart it; it re-bootstraps and re-learns
   state via anti-entropy (the [restart](#restart-behaviour) path). The window is safe because a
   new-version node re-encodes forwarded frames at `WIRE_VERSION`, so the cluster converges toward
   the new format as you progress.
3. **Verify before the next node.** `GET /stats` on the just-upgraded node — `dropped_frames` steady
   (not climbing) and it is hearing peers. A climbing `dropped_frames` or an `UnsupportedWireVersion`
   in logs means a **two-step** gap: stop and reconcile before continuing.

The back-compat this relies on is regression-gated — the wire corpus + `decode_wire_v11_*` gate
(see the [testing page](../wiki/dev/testing/testing.md)) — so a release that would break the mixed
window fails CI, not your rollout.

## Backup & restore

Persistence is a **WAL + periodic snapshot** in the node's data directory, and identity is
the Ed25519 key/cert under `auto_cert_dir`. Both are plain on-disk state, so backup and
restore are just directory operations:

- **Back up** the persistence data dir *and* the `auto_cert_dir` (the identity). Snapshot
  the volume, or copy the dirs while the node runs — the WAL makes a copy taken mid-write
  self-consistent on replay.
- **Restore** = put the dirs back where the node expects them and start it. On boot it
  loads the latest snapshot and replays the WAL tail on top of it (last-writer-wins per key,
  every record), then re-bootstraps and re-learns any newer KV from peers via anti-entropy
  (same path as [restart](#restart-behaviour)). Keeping
  `auto_cert_dir` means the node comes back with the *same* identity — no re-issue, no
  signature churn, and its audit/consensus history stays attributable to it.

Because state also lives redundantly across the mesh, a single node's data dir is not the
only copy of the cluster's KV — but it **is** the only copy of that node's identity and its
per-node audit chain ([audit.md](audit.md)), so the `auto_cert_dir` is the part you cannot
regenerate. Back it up. (There is no snapshot/restore *API* — Mycelium is a library; the
data dir is the interface.)
