# `docs/plans/` — index

The front door for this directory. A plan here is one of three kinds: a **shipped
execution record** (what was built and *why* — kept as institutional memory, not a
to-do), a **design sketch** (rationale, possibly superseded by a build plan), or a
**research-track** item. A `✅` status header in the file is authoritative; this
index just routes you to the right one.

**Canonical homes elsewhere:** per-milestone *design* lives in
[`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md); architecture invariants in
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md); cross-cutting design decisions in
[`docs/design/`](../design/). These plans are strategy/sequencing + execution
record, not duplicates of those.

> **As of 2026-07-04, every engineering plan is shipped.** v2.0's acceptance gate is met —
> all 16 milestones (M1–M16) ([`v2.0.md`](v2.0.md)) — and both former *proposed* plans have
> since shipped: **Legible Emergence** (complete, phases 0–5, 2026-07-03) and
> **mycelium-wiki** (complete, build phases 1–5 + gateway/SDKs + access broker, 2026-07-04;
> the only remaining slice is the *additive* disconnected KV-native variant). The one open
> non-engineering item is a **research experiment** (three-arm work distribution, for Paper 1).
>
> **v3.0 (proposed, 2026-07-05/06):** a pattern-landscape scan found the substrate covers the
> *coordination* pattern space natively or by composition ([`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) → v3.0).
> **Two primary deliverables**, each substrate-native: [`mycelium-reason.md`](mycelium-reason.md) — the
> LLM-authoring DX companion — and [`mycelium-guardrails.md`](mycelium-guardrails.md) — structural,
> coordinator-free guardrails (per-receiver enforcement, no central chokepoint). Plus packaging
> candidates + one ANP adapter. (RAG / HITL / content guardrails are *use-case functions* — external
> services accessed through the mesh, the wiki precedent — not substrate work.)

## Shipped — execution records (the "what + why")

The reasoning behind decisions — including the **declined-with-reasoning** calls a
future contributor needs so they don't re-litigate a settled choice — lives here.

## Design sketches (rationale)

| Doc | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`mycelium-blackboard.md`](mycelium-blackboard.md) | The blackboard *design rationale* (worked example, `rd`/`in` split, non-goals). ✅ Built — the phased build plan is [`v2-wsg-g3-blackboard.md`](v2-wsg-g3-blackboard.md). |

## Proposed — not yet started

_None._ The SOC 2 audit-gap plan (previously here) shipped complete 2026-07-22 — see the
execution-records table above.

Prior proposed plans (Legible Emergence; mycelium-wiki) have shipped — see the execution-records
table above. The other open engineering slice is the **additive** disconnected KV-native wiki
variant (design record [`../design/wiki-concurrent-edit.md`](../design/wiki-concurrent-edit.md)),
started only if a no-external-store deployment needs it. Research-track work (Paper 1's three-arm
experiment) is tracked in [`docs/wiki/domain/publications.md`](../wiki/domain/publications.md).

## Research track — in progress

| Doc | Status |
|---|---|
| [`three_arm_workdist.md`](three_arm_workdist.md) | ⏳ **In progress** — the three-arm work-distribution experiment Paper 1 §9.5 calls for. The harness code is built (`examples/three_arm_workdist.rs` + `three_arm_runner.sh` + `three_arm_plot.py`); the *run + analysis + write-up* is the pending research deliverable. The one genuinely-open plan in this directory. |

*Completed plans are kept, not deleted: a `COMPLETE` header graduates a plan from a
to-do into documentation — it earns its place by recording the reasoning. They are
not moved to an archive subdir because ~13 cross-links from ROADMAP/CLAUDE/the guide
point into this directory; the status headers + this index provide the legibility
without the link churn.*
