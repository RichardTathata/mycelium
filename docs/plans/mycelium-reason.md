# mycelium-reason — LLM DX strategy (design sketch)

**Status:** 🟡 **IN PROGRESS — implementation started 2026-07-08.** Build-vs-adopt resolved to a **three-tier
strategy** (build / adopt / interop) with a **Tier-3-first** sequence. The substrate needs no new
capability. Positioning source: [`../wiki/domain/pattern-coverage.md`](../wiki/domain/pattern-coverage.md)
→ the LLM-authoring DX axis. **Amended 2026-07-07** (artifact-library implications — see the
dated addendum §below): checkpoint storage pattern fixed, wedge ③ added, Tier-3 ① partially
de-risked. **Amended 2026-07-08** (pre-implementation reassessment, code-verified — five
binding findings incl. one correction to the 07-07 addendum; see §below).

## The question this settles

"Roll our own LLM DX framework, or map/support a popular one?" — **neither extreme.** The popular DX
(LangGraph, Instructor, Pydantic AI, CrewAI) is almost all **Python** and operates at layers a
*substrate sits under*. So: **adopt** the commodity layers, **be the distributed backend** for the
orchestration layer, and **build** only the differentiators nothing else can offer. Rolling a full
framework would reimplement commodities in the wrong language for a community that won't switch tools
to get them.

## The compelling frame — substrate-native, not a framework port

The same coordinator-free properties that make *coordination* resilient make *reasoning* resilient:
inference routed with no central proxy, tamper-evident causal traces of the whole fleet's thinking,
memory that hands off between agents, graphs that outlive their orchestrator. Additive value a
single-process framework **structurally cannot** offer.

## The three tiers

### Tier 3 — BUILD (our differentiators; un-adoptable because nothing else has the mesh)
- **① Capability-routed inference** — route each call to a healthy model-advertising node
  (`cap/{node}/llm/inference`) via capability resolution + opacity back-pressure. Elastic, load-aware
  inference across the fleet, **no central proxy** (vs a LiteLLM proxy you operate). *New: a
  resilience/routing policy over `LlmBackend`.*
- **② Fleet-reasoning traces** — extend the HLC audit chain + `/gateway/explain` to LLM-run
  granularity: **tamper-evident, causal, replayable traces of why the whole fleet reasoned as it did.**
  Single-process tracers see one process. *New: run-level trace records; replay via the event log.*

- **③ Artifact-aware resume** *(added 2026-07-07 — enabled by the artifact library,
  [`../design/artifact-library.md`](../design/artifact-library.md))* — a resumed graph's **model
  dependencies follow it**: resource-aware self-election decides *which* node picks a suspended
  thread up (only one whose probe says the required model fits), and demand-driven install
  streams the model in where the thread lands. "Resume on any node" is hollow if the node lacks
  the 4 GB model the graph calls; with this, it isn't. *New: a thin mapping from a resumed
  graph's model needs to `declare_requirement` — the library machinery already exists and was
  proven live (`model_deploy`).*

All three **mostly compose** from existing substrate. Exposed through `mycelium-py` so they compose
*with* the Tier-1/2 tools, not replace them.

### Tier 1 — ADOPT (commodity library layer; wrap, don't rebuild)
- **Typed output → [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/)** (~3M downloads/mo — a thin client
  patch) or **[Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/)**. `mycelium-py` wraps these for the `call_typed`
  closure — no custom typed-output+retry. (Schemas stay fleet-shared via the registry.)
- **Provider access →** provider SDKs / LiteLLM-*as-library* for the 100+ adapters; drop its central
  *proxy* — Tier 3 ① replaces it.

### Tier 2 — INTEROP / BE-THE-BACKEND (map/support the popular frameworks)
- **`langgraph-checkpoint-mycelium`** — LangGraph's pluggable
  [`BaseCheckpointSaver`/Store protocol](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/persistence)
  (`get_tuple`/`list`/`put`/`put_writes`) backed by Mycelium KV + the `append`/`scan_log` log overlay.
  One-line swap → LangGraph agent state becomes **coordinator-free, gossip-replicated, resumable across
  nodes** (the `Suspended`/resume + hand-off value, delivered through *their* abstraction). Directly
  answers "why not just LangGraph?" → *"Use it — on Mycelium; now it survives node loss and hands off
  across the fleet."*
- Extends to CrewAI / AutoGen memory backends + the existing MCP + A2A adapters.

**Relationship to the existing `examples/a2a_langchain/` — a different layer, not a duplicate (avoid
scatter).** That example is **A2A interop, direction LangChain → Mycelium**: a LangChain/AutoGen agent
discovers Mycelium *skills* via `/.well-known/agent.json` and calls them as tools (Mycelium is the
*tool provider*). The checkpointer is the **reverse and deeper**: **LangGraph runs *on* Mycelium**, its
graph state backed by the mesh (Mycelium is the *resilient state backend*). These teach different
things — do **not** merge them. Anti-scatter rule for this deliverable: ship **one** *Mycelium ×
LangChain/LangGraph integration map* (interop edge = A2A, exists · state backend = checkpointer ·
reasoning wedges = Tier 3 · typed output = Tier 1) that labels each touchpoint and when to use it, so
there is a single coherent integration story rather than several look-alike "LangChain examples."

## Sequencing — Tier 3 first, then Tier 1 ∥ Tier 2

**Differentiators first, to a *validated wedge*** (one CI-tested example each — the pattern-gallery
bar; not gold-plated). Rationale: the differentiator is what gives the adopt/interop its **pull**. A
Mycelium-backed LangGraph checkpointer that is *only* durable state competes with Postgres/Redis on
commodity terms and loses on maturity; the same checkpointer that *also* surfaces capability-routed
inference + fleet traces is a category of one. Build the reason-to-adopt first, then distribute it.

Then **Tier 1 (Instructor wrap) ∥ Tier 2 (LangGraph checkpointer)** in parallel — independent surfaces
(`mycelium-py` vs a LangGraph package), and **Tier 2 is built to *expose* the Tier-3 wedges** so it
lands differentiated, not commoditised.

**Trade-off, named honestly:** Tier-3-first pushes time-to-first-external-user slightly later than an
adopt-first land-grab would. For a thesis-led, pre-adoption project that is the right call —
*why Mycelium* before *Mycelium everywhere*.

## Concrete deliverables

| Tier | Deliverable | Home | Nature |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3 (first) | capability-routed inference · fleet-reasoning traces · artifact-aware resume | `mycelium-reason` crate + `mycelium-py` | build (mostly composes) |
| 1 (∥) | `call_typed` over Instructor / Pydantic AI | `mycelium-py` | adopt — ✅ shipped 2026-07-08 |
| 2 (∥) | `langgraph-checkpoint-mycelium` | new Python package | interop / be-the-backend — ✅ shipped 2026-07-08 |

Tier 3 shipped as PR 1 (the `mycelium-reason` crate); Tiers 1+2 shipped as PR 2 with the
repo's first Python CI job (two-node mesh, real `StateGraph` cross-node resume).

## What already exists (the composition base — mostly packaging)

`PromptTemplate` (KV, fleet-shared) · `LlmBackend`/`OpenAiBackend` + `/gateway/llm/stream` · MCP tool
discovery · `AgentStateMachine` (Planning/Invoking/Reflecting/Suspended/… + `max_turns`/`tool_budget`
+ `watch_mesh_states`) · schema registry (`schemas/`) · HLC audit chain + OTEL + `/gateway/explain` ·
`kv().append`/`scan_log` event log · `mycelium-wiki` durable memory · **the artifact library**
(shipped 2026-07-07: content-addressed durable blobs, librarian discovery, resource-aware
self-election, probe-gated model deployment — proven live with a real GGUF in `model_deploy`).
The Rust core needs **zero changes** (companion-crate contract); integration is
application-layer, much of it in `mycelium-py`.

## Non-goals

- A first-class **orchestrator** (the substrate's deliberate non-goal — `docs/philosophy.md`).
- **Declarative prompt optimization** (DSPy-style compile-from-examples) — research-track, watch-only.
- Reimplementing a provider SDK, or a typed-output library — Tier 1 adopts those.

## Addendum (2026-07-07) — what the artifact library changes here

Written the day the artifact-library workstream shipped
([`../design/artifact-library.md`](../design/artifact-library.md), ✅ same-day). Three
implications are **binding on the implementation strategy**; the rest of this sketch stands.

1. **The checkpointer's storage layer follows the metadata-in-KV / payload-in-a-tier pattern —
   from day one, not after a scale surprise.** The original line "backed by Mycelium KV + the
   log overlay" under-specified storage. Two substrate facts rule out naïve
   checkpoint-blobs-in-KV: **KV floods every node** (every agent's channel state — message
   histories, easily 100s of KB per super-step per thread — replicated fleet-wide), and writes
   are size-gated (`MAX_KV_WRITE_BYTES`). The house answer is now thrice-proven (wiki → artifact
   library → here): *a store's cardinality follows the scope of what it stores* — *thread
   index/heads/metadata in gossiped KV (tiny, fleet-visible); checkpoint payloads in a tiered
   store.* And the sharper fact: **LangGraph checkpoints are immutable once written** (a
   `checkpoint_id` is a snapshot), i.e. they are **content-addressable blobs** — the artifact
   library's storage half (content-addressed immutable blobs, verified fetch, `FsLibrarySource`/
   `PrefetchingSource`-shaped tiers) is the closer fit than KV, and **channel-value dedup across
   super-steps falls out of content addressing for free** (a real cost issue for chatty graphs).
   The one-day spike below must evaluate exactly this design, not only the KV mapping.
2. **Wedge ③ (artifact-aware resume) joins the differentiation story** — see Tier 3. It upgrades
   the flagship demo from "durable state" to "durable state **plus model logistics**": *kill a
   node mid-graph → the thread resumes elsewhere via the checkpointer → the model it needs
   streams in through the library with real progress → the graph continues → the audit chain
   shows all of it.* `model_deploy` already proved the model half live. Postgres/Redis cannot
   express this — it is the strongest available answer to "a checkpointer that is only durable
   state competes on commodity terms and loses."
3. **Tier-3 ① is partially de-risked.** Capability-routed inference presupposes models existing
   *at capabilities* across the fleet; that was aspirational and is now deployable, probe-gated,
   and attribute-advertised (`cap/{node}/llm/inference` with model/context attrs). Tier-3-first
   stands, with a shorter path.

Honest counter-note: the **`mycelium-py` gap widened slightly** — the checkpointer is Python and
none of the artifact-library surface has py bindings (the checkpointer itself likely needs only
KV/gateway access; wedge ③'s py surface is `declare_requirement`, which the SDK already speaks).
The flagship also inherits this session's delivery machinery: the ADR-first template, the CI
flake tier (its cross-node integration tests will want it), and the honest-demo bar (a real
LangGraph graph, never a simulated one).

## Addendum (2026-07-08) — pre-implementation reassessment (code-verified)

Written at implementation start, after a code-level verification pass over every surface this
sketch composes from. Five findings are **binding on the implementation**; the strategy,
tiers, and sequencing stand.

1. **Resolution is load-blind — wedge ① is a real routing layer, not a byproduct.** The
   original wedge ① line said "via capability resolution **+ opacity back-pressure**", but
   `resolve`/`resolve_for_caller` rank only by freshness, attribute constraints, and locality;
   opacity/load influence provider selection **only indirectly** (an overloaded node's `cap/`
   entry ages out) or via the separate `suggest_leader*` API. So the wedge is exactly the "new:
   resilience/routing policy" the sketch predicted, now concrete: *resolve → drop opaque nodes
   (`is_node_opaque`) → rank by `peer_load` fill → failover retry down the candidate list.*
2. **Correction: no attributed inference-capability convention exists yet.** The 2026-07-07
   addendum's "now … attribute-advertised (`cap/{node}/llm/inference` with model/context
   attrs)" overstated what shipped: `model_deploy` advertises a plain `llm/storyteller`
   capability (no attributes), and `register_prompt_skill` advertises `Capability::new(ns,name)`
   with no attribute support. Convention bound now: **a model is a prompt skill** — cap
   `llm/{model-id}` (matching the `model_deploy` precedent) — plus a parallel **attributed
   metadata ad** `llm-meta/{model-id}` (ctx window, family), RAII-tied to the skill
   registration. (A second ad is needed because re-advertising the *same* `(node,ns,name)` key
   with attributes would LWW-churn against the skill's own 30 s persist task.) Upstream
   candidate, deliberately not taken — zero-core-changes stands: an attributed
   `register_prompt_skill` overload.
3. **Wedge ② rides the log overlay, not the `EventRing`.** `EventRing`/`record_event` are
   `pub(crate)` — a companion cannot extend `/gateway/explain`. Bound: trace records go through
   `kv().append(…)` (HLC-ordered, gossip-replicated, replayable via `scan_log`); the crate
   mounts its own `GET /gateway/reason/trace/{run_id}` via `with_http_routes` (the wiki
   precedent); tamper-evidence is optional **anchoring of the running trace hash into the WS2
   audit chain** (`GossipAgent::audit`, `compliance` feature).
   *Corrected during implementation (2026-07-08):* the originally-bound **single shared stream
   `reason/{run_id}` cannot host multiple writers** — the HLC packs 48-bit milliseconds + a
   16-bit *per-node* logical counter, so two nodes appending in the same millisecond mint
   identical `log/…/{hlc:016x}` keys and LWW silently drops a record (caught by the cross-node
   trace test on its first run). Shipped shape: **one substream per writer**,
   `reason/{run_id}/{node}`, merged on HLC at replay with a node-id tiebreak (equal stamps are
   concurrent by definition).
4. **The checkpointer's content-addressed tier needs a mesh-reachable blob surface — and
   `mycelium-reason` must provide it.** Nothing exposes artifact storage over the gateway
   today, and `mycelium-wasm-host` carries wasmtime **unconditionally**, so reusing
   `FsLibrarySource` would drag wasmtime into this crate. Bound: a minimal content-addressed
   `FsBlobStore` (SHA-256 id, temp-write+rename, verify-on-read — `FsLibrarySource` semantics)
   + peer fetch over RPC (`reason.blob.fetch`; providers discovered via a `reason/blob-cache`
   capability — the `MeshArtifactSource` pattern) + gateway blob PUT/GET routes. Cross-node
   resume *requires* this: metadata gossips everywhere, but payloads must be fetchable from
   wherever the thread lands. v1 limit, stated honestly: one blob ≤ 8 MiB (single-frame RPC;
   chunked transfer is a follow-up). Consequence: the artifact library's storage half now has a
   **second consumer** that cannot accept wasmtime — direct evidence for resolving the open
   crate-naming/extraction question; `FsBlobStore` swaps out for the extracted crate when that
   lands.
5. **Wedge ③ ships its demand half only.** `declare_requirement(CapFilter llm/{model})` +
   structural await-ready polling + surfacing the `{ns}/loading` `pct` tier. The install half
   (provisioner, probes, self-election) stays deployment wiring in `mycelium-wasm-host` —
   already shipped.

Delivery shape for this pass: **PR 1** — the `mycelium-reason` companion crate (wedges ① ② ③,
blob tier, gateway routes, multi-node tests, `ci_smoke` example, CI job, lock-order rows).
**PR 2** — `langgraph-checkpoint-mycelium` (Tier 2) + `call_typed` in `mycelium-py` (Tier 1) +
the repo's **first Python CI job** (none exists today; the SDK's tests are run-manually-only).

## Addendum (2026-09-04) — NVIDIA PAIR: the comparison, and what was imported

NVIDIA announced the **Personal AI Router (PAIR)** on 3 Sept 2026 (IFA; Apache-2.0; beta
v0.1.x): a proxy in front of Ollama / LM Studio that discovers a household's machines, pairs
them (six-digit PIN → mTLS), and places each *independent* inference request on the machine
with capacity — per-node ranking on pending-job counts plus local reservations, no global
schedule, explicit "we do not split a model or move a running request". It virtualises
inference capacity for existing apps by taking over the Ollama/OpenAI endpoint.

**Read against wedge ①, verified in code.** PAIR is exactly the slice `InferenceRouter` covers
(model-aware, load-aware, failover-capable placement) productised for one household with a
drop-in endpoint. Two places our own story over-credited us: (a) the load signal —
`LoadState.fill_ratio` is a self-reported handler-channel fill, no richer than PAIR's
pending-job count (the *constraint* vocabulary via `llm-meta` is richer; the *load* input was
not); (b) the rank was `(fill, node id)` with a deterministic tiebreak, so N concurrent callers
on one node all chose the same provider until its pheromone caught up — the herd PAIR's
reservations exist for. Position: **PAIR is the GPU plane, Mycelium the agent plane**
(capabilities, state, tools, traces, resume); where PAIR is absent Mycelium can be both; they
stack (point `OpenAiBackend` at a PAIR proxy). Not competing on installer UX, pairing flows, or
engine integrations — NVIDIA's leverage, and not a library's job.

**Imported (all shipped 2026-09-04, `mycelium-reason` 0.6.0), bindings:**

1. **Local reservations** — `InferenceRouter::inflight` (`Mutex<HashMap<node, u32>>`,
   lock-order row 36): each open call against a provider adds `reservation_weight` (default
   0.1) to its rank score. *Philosophy check:* node-local knowledge composed with the shared
   medium — the reservation is neither gossiped nor written as a pheromone; the provider's own
   trail stays the fleet-wide signal. No wire change, no core change. The trace `route` event's
   per-candidate value is now `score`, not `fill`.
2. **The OpenAI-compatible façade** — `/gateway/reason/v1/{chat/completions,models}` on the
   same `reason_router`, sharing one `InferenceRouter` (so reservations span concurrent gateway
   requests — a router-per-request would see an empty map). Mounted **under `/gateway/`** on
   purpose: it rides the gateway auth boundary (bearer = API key) rather than a bare `/v1`
   that would be public by path. The mapping to a prompt skill is stated in the module doc
   (last user message → `input`; `system`/`history` context; template-bound sampling params;
   one-chunk SSE for `stream: true`). Ollama-native `/api/chat` is *not* served — a follow-up
   if a consumer needs it.
3. **The `llm-meta` vocabulary + collector** — `llm_meta::*` constants with types and sources
   (the honest split: `warm`/`vram_used_mb` come from the engine's process list;
   `vram_free_mb`/`tokens_per_sec` are embedder-measured because engines do not report them);
   `ModelReg::refresh_meta` for the dynamic attributes — retract-then-advertise on one key
   *could* lose to the persist task's tombstone on the node's HLC, so the retraction is
   *observed* (bounded structural poll on `resolve`) before the new ad publishes. Stated
   honestly: the bare form did **not** blink in 60 measured flips (tokio runs the woken old
   task before the new interval's first tick), so the sequencing makes an incidental
   ordering explicit rather than fixing a reproduced bug; feature `ollama` for
   the collector (`/api/ps` + `/api/show`) and `spawn_meta_refresher`. The router remains
   engine-blind: attributes are the only thing the mesh sees.

**Found on the way (core, fixed same day):** routers merged via `with_http_routes` were
*outside* the gateway auth `route_layer` — every companion's `/gateway/…` surface answered
without a bearer while its docs claimed coverage. Fixed with a prefix-guarded layer on merged
routers; ledger entry in `docs/analysis/ratings.md` (Security scored 8 at Run 59).

**Not imported, deliberately:** the pairing-PIN bootstrap (CA admission is the fleet-scale
equivalent), the installer, the licence (theirs affects vendors embedding the GPU plane —
not the layer this project sells; the dual licence stands).

## Expressible ≠ validated

Every wedge and the checkpointer fit are **hypotheses until tested**. The checkpointer mapping
(versioned KV + log ↔ checkpoints + pending writes) *looks* natural but needs a **one-day spike**
before commitment — and per the 2026-07-07 addendum, the spike's first question is the storage
split (metadata-in-KV + content-addressed payload tier), not the protocol mapping. Each Tier-3 wedge earns its claim with a `ci_smoke`-bar example — the same bar
blackboard/tuple-space met. This also raises **`mycelium-py` to a first-class citizen** — a deliberate
strategic choice, since the ecosystem the strategy targets is Python.

## Trigger to revisit

A customer building reasoning agents *on the mesh* who hits the DX cliff, or a positioning need to
answer "why not just LangGraph on top?" with an ergonomic story, not only a coordination one.
