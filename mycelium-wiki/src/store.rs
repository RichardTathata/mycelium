//! The **data-plane interface** — the pluggable backing store a group's wiki lives in. Deliberately
//! substrate-agnostic: an `FsStore` (this crate), an `S3Store`, or a doc-store all implement it, and
//! the Mycelium control plane (Phase 2) drives whichever the group is configured with.
//!
//! **Concurrency contract.** The store is **airtight under concurrent writers** — it does not *assume*
//! a single writer, it *enforces* one per object via compare-and-swap. Two writers (e.g. a transient
//! split-brain where the ring briefly elects two curators) can no longer clobber each other:
//!
//! - **Section body edits** go through [`write_section`](WikiStore::write_section), a CAS keyed on the
//!   section's own version — an independent slot per section, so two curators editing *different*
//!   sections of one page never contend, and two editing the *same* section serialise (the stale one
//!   gets [`WikiError::Conflict`] and must re-read + re-reconcile).
//! - **Membership / order / page attributes** go through [`update_manifest`](WikiStore::update_manifest),
//!   a CAS keyed on the manifest version.
//! - A CAS write returns [`WikiError::Conflict`] instead of silently overwriting; the curator treats
//!   that as "re-read the committed state and re-apply".
//!
//! The CAS is **at-least-once, never-lose**: a version can be consumed by a follower (who reads it and
//! builds the next version on top) and then re-applied on the original writer's retry, so a `Conflict`
//! caller may apply its edit more than once — but no committed edit is ever *lost*. Exactly-once
//! *effect* therefore comes from the caller's reconcile being **idempotent** (the append-merge skips an
//! already-contained edit) — the same at-least-once + idempotent-merge = exactly-once-effect contract
//! the tuple space and blackboard use (see `docs/design/exactly-once-effect.md`). Bounded disk (old
//! versions are GC'd) is why the store cannot promise exactly-once at its own layer.
//!
//! Readers are still torn-read-safe: a store publishes each object atomically and a reader entering via
//! the manifest never observes a half-applied edit. [`write_page`](WikiStore::write_page) remains as a
//! non-CAS full-replace convenience (page bootstrap / tests); the concurrent write path is the CAS pair.
