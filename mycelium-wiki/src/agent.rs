//! The **control plane** (Phase 2) — the Mycelium side. A group's wiki is served by a single elected
//! **curator** discovered on the capability ring, with emergent ring-failover. The curator serialises
//! writes (drains the evaporating KV proposal queue and applies each to the store — the single writer
//! of record) and advertises the store location; every agent **reads the store directly**. Because the
//! store is node-independent, failover transfers nothing: a promoted curator resumes against the
//! *same* store and re-drains the *same* proposals.
//!
//! Feature-gated (`control-plane`) so Phase 1's pure data plane stays Mycelium-agnostic.
