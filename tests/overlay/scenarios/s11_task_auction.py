"""S11 — exact-once log consumption (single-active consumer group).

A coordinator appends 5 tasks to a log stream on node-a. Two subscribers (on node-b and
node-c) join the same ``subscribe_log_group(stream, "workers")`` group. The group is
**single-active**: one subscriber wins the consensus claim and drains the stream; the other
stands by (it would take over on failover). This is *not* a load-balanced work queue — the
group does not split entries across active consumers (for that, use the tuple-space companion,
which claims each item atomically). So one worker may receive all 5 and the other 0; what the
test enforces is **exact-once**, not distribution.

Verification:
  - 5 tasks received in total across both workers (no loss, no duplication).
  - Each task value received exactly once.
  - Each worker sees its tasks in HLC order (monotonically non-decreasing).

The exact-once guarantee rests on the consensus-backed claim (issue #149): a bare-LWW claim
admitted multiple active consumers and double-delivered (got 10 for 5 tasks).
