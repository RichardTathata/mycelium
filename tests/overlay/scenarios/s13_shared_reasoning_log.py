"""S13 — Shared Reasoning Log (multi-writer, gossip convergence).

Each of the three overlay nodes appends 3 "observations" to the shared
"observations" stream, for 9 entries total.

Verification:
  - Every node can scan the full log and see all 9 entries.
  - Entries are returned in non-decreasing HLC order on every node.
  - compact_log removes old entries without corrupting the remainder.
