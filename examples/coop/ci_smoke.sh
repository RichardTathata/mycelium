# Docker-free smoke for the Food-Rescue Co-op suite. Runs each shipped demo and asserts on its
# output. Mirrors examples/fluid_pipeline/ci_smoke.sh. Exits non-zero on any failure.
#
# Each demo is a multi-node in-process TLS cluster whose convergence is timing-sensitive; on a
# shared/constrained CI runner a single attempt can miss a structural-poll deadline. So each demo
# gets up to ATTEMPTS tries — a real regression fails all of them, a transient slow-runner miss does
# not. (The same posture as the wasm-host e2e port retry and the tuple-space rpc_roundtrip primary
# poll.) Output of the last attempt is always printed for diagnosis.
