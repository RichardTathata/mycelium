# Skills — LLM Agents as Mesh Citizens

## Objective

LLM agents become first-class mesh citizens: each **Skill** advertises its
prompt as a capability, and skills are discovered and load-balanced across the
mesh with no orchestrator holding a routing table. A skill is an LLM agent that
lives permanently in the mesh as its own node — network identity, capability
advertisement, prompt — defined entirely in a TOML manifest, no code. Unlike an
MCP tool, a skill can call other skills: it lists sub-skills in `tools = [...]`,
and SkillRunner resolves those names against live capability advertisements in
the KV store at inference time and dispatches via mesh RPC. Because resolution
happens at call time through the gossip layer, starting a second provider
load-balances automatically — no configuration change.

## How to run

See [shared setup](../README.md#shared-setup) for the Rust toolchain and Ollama.

```bash
cargo build --bin skillrunner
```

(Uses `llama3.2` by default — or point any skill's `skill.llm.endpoint` at an OpenAI-compatible URL.)

### End-to-end demo (recommended)

```bash
cd examples/community
./demo.sh
```

`demo.sh` starts the cluster, waits for gossip convergence, invokes the
pipeline with a sample topic, then adds a **second researcher live** to show
automatic load-balancing — all in one terminal. Open
http://localhost:9050/mgmt in a browser while it runs to watch mesh state.

### Manual

```bash
cd examples/community
./start.sh           # orchestrator :7950, researcher :7952, writer :7953
sleep 3              # wait for gossip to converge

# `invoke.sh` wraps `cargo run --example invoke_skill` (examples/invoke_skill.rs) and drives it with
# SKILL_CALLER_PORT / SKILL_NODE_PORT / SKILL_CAP / SKILL_PAYLOAD; run the example directly to call
# any advertised skill from a one-shot caller.
./invoke.sh "gossip protocols"                    # technical style
./invoke.sh "Rust ownership" casual               # casual tone
./invoke.sh "large language models" executive 8  # executive, 8 findings

./stop.sh
```

### Scaling — add a second researcher

```bash
cp researcher.skill.toml researcher2.skill.toml
# Edit: bind_port = 7954
../../target/debug/skillrunner --skill researcher2.skill.toml &
```

Within one gossip interval (~5 s) the orchestrator sees two providers for
`llm/researcher` and load-balances across both automatically.

## What it demonstrates

The concept — skills as capabilities and skill-to-skill composition — is
covered in the guide: [`docs/guide/05-skills.md`](../../docs/guide/05-skills.md).
The mechanism lives in the SkillRunner binary
([`src/bin/skillrunner/runner.rs`](../../src/bin/skillrunner/runner.rs) —
`resolve_tools` and the `rpc_call` dispatch).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant O as orchestrator :7950
    participant R as researcher :7952
    participant W as writer :7953

    You->>O: POST /invoke {"topic":"gossip protocols"}
    O->>O: LLM planning: tools=[researcher, writer]
    O->>R: rpc_call skill.invoke {"topic":"gossip protocols"}
    R->>R: LLM generates findings
    R-->>O: {"findings":[...], "summary":"..."}
    O->>W: rpc_call skill.invoke {"topic":..., "findings":[...]}
    W->>W: LLM writes article
    W-->>O: {"title":"...", "article":"...", "tldr":"..."}
    O-->>You: writer's output
```

### The causal chain (what to observe)

Follow logs across all nodes in a second terminal:

```bash
tail -f examples/community/logs/orchestrator.log \
        examples/community/logs/researcher.log \
        examples/community/logs/writer.log
```

You'll see the full causal chain as it happens:

```
[orchestrator] Received invoke: topic="gossip protocols"
[orchestrator] → tool_call: researcher  {"topic": "gossip protocols", "max_points": 5}
[researcher]   Received invoke
[researcher]   LLM generating findings...
[researcher]   → reply: {"findings": [...], "summary": "..."}
[orchestrator] ← tool_result: researcher  (5 findings)
[orchestrator] → tool_call: writer  {"topic": ..., "findings": [...]}
[writer]       Received invoke
[writer]       LLM generating article...
[writer]       → reply: {"title": "...", "article": "...", "tldr": "..."}
[orchestrator] ← tool_result: writer
[orchestrator] → final reply to caller
```

Each arrow is a real RPC call through the Mycelium gossip layer.

### How resolution works

Each `.skill.toml` has four sections: `[node]` (gossip config), `[capability]`
(what the skill advertises), `[skill]` (prompt + tools), `[skill.llm]`
(model config).

The orchestrator's tools list uses `ns/name` format:

```toml
# orchestrator.skill.toml
[skill]
tools = ["llm/researcher", "llm/writer"]
```

SkillRunner (`src/bin/skillrunner/runner.rs:resolve_tools`) scans
`skills/llm/researcher/*/input` keys in the KV store to build the tool schema
list. The LM-visible name is the bare name (`researcher`, not `llm/researcher`)
because OpenAI function names cannot contain `/`.

When the LLM calls `researcher`, SkillRunner scans the KV for the `llm`
namespace, resolves the live node, and dispatches via `rpc_call`.

### Skill reference

| Skill | Port | Prompt focus | max_tokens |
|-------|------|-------------|------------|
| `orchestrator` | 7950 | Coordinates — delegates all LLM work | 512 |
| `researcher` | 7952 | Extract N key facts, return JSON | 1024 |
| `writer` | 7953 | Title, article body, TL;DR | 2048 |
| `verifier` | 7955 | Claims-checking pipeline guard | 2048 |

The orchestrator's low token budget is intentional: it coordinates cheaply
and leaves the substantive LLM work to specialist skills.

### Management dashboard

The orchestrator exposes a live mesh dashboard at http://localhost:9050/mgmt.
It shows every skill advertising on the mesh, provider count, and the recent
invocation audit trail — all from the local KV store, auto-refreshing every
4 s.

### Audit trail

Every invocation writes a signed audit record to the KV store:

```bash
# Visible on the dashboard, or from Rust:
agent.scan_prefix("audit/")
```

Records are HLC-ordered, Ed25519-signed by the invoking node, and replicated
to every node in the cluster via gossip.

### Sample output

[`sample-output/gossip-protocols.md`](sample-output/gossip-protocols.md) and
[`sample-output/rust-ownership.md`](sample-output/rust-ownership.md) show
real pipeline output including per-step traces and final articles.

## Dev notes

**Access control.** To restrict who can call a skill:

```toml
[capability.policy]
authorized_callers = ["orchestrator"]
max_concurrent = 4
```

SkillRunner enforces this before invoking the LLM.

**Model selection.** Each skill can use a different model and endpoint. Set
`[skill.llm.endpoint]` to any OpenAI-compatible URL.

**OTel tracing.** Build with `--features otel` and add `[skill.otel]` to any
manifest for Jaeger/Grafana spans per invocation.

**Prompt tips for llama3.2 (3B).** Keep the orchestrator prompt under 150 words.
Reference tools by bare name. Set `temperature = 0.1` for deterministic routing.
For better reliability use `llama3.1:8b` as the orchestrator model.

### Next steps

- **A2A integration** — [`examples/a2a_langchain/`](../a2a_langchain/README.md): LangChain
  and AutoGen agents auto-discover these skills via `/.well-known/agent.json`
- **MCP tool discovery** — [`examples/chat/`](../chat/README.md): the simpler
  alternative where tools are functions, not LLM agents
