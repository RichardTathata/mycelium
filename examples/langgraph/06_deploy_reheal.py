"""
Rung 6 of the LangGraph example ladder (docs/plans/mycelium-reason-examples.md):
the **deploy/reheal flagship** — echo variant.

What this demo proves, end to end and deterministically:

    A LangGraph graph's *model dependency follows it across a node failure.*

A graph is checkpointed on node A (via ``MyceliumCheckpointSaver`` → A's gateway) and
interrupted before its LLM step. Node A — the only node serving the model — is then
**killed**. Node B, which did not serve the model at start, has *rehealed* it: its reheal
task declared the demand (``require_model`` → gossiped ``req/``), fetched the model
artifact over the mesh (a real cross-node ``MeshBlobStore`` fetch with SHA-256 verify),
and **bridged** it into a live ``serve_model`` skill. The thread resumes via B's gateway,
its routed LLM call lands on B, and the graph finishes — the model followed the thread.

The echo-fixture honesty caveat
-------------------------------
The "model artifact" is a tiny content-addressed blob and "serving" it is
``serve_model(EchoBackend)`` — the output is ``echo: {input}``, wasmtime-free and
deterministic (so this runs in CI). What is REAL is the seam: require_model → gossiped
demand → mesh blob fetch + verify → the serve_model bridge → routed resume. The showcase
variant (a later PR) streams actual GGUF weights via ``model_deploy``'s BlobRuntime and
serves them through local Ollama — same seam, real bytes. This demo proves the wiring, it
does not pretend the blob is a neural network.

The honest ordering (no faked instantaneity)
---------------------------------------------
Both handoffs wait for eventual consistency to converge *before* the kill, and both waits
are bounded structural polls (never fixed sleeps as the mechanism):

  1. The checkpoint replicates A → B (gossip) before A is killed.
  2. B's reheal task fetches the artifact from A (mesh) while A is still alive, and
     write-back caches it locally — so B keeps serving after A dies.

Run it directly (it manages its own two-node mesh, model_deploy-style):

    cargo build -p mycelium-reason --features llm,gateway --example reheal_node
    python examples/langgraph/06_deploy_reheal.py

Exits 0 after printing ``FLAGSHIP OK``; exits 1 on any assertion failure (dumping node
logs). Kills both nodes on every exit path.

# SEAM NOTE (a real finding, now FIXED in the router): a killed node lingers in a peer's
# *capability freshness* view for ~90s (it stops refreshing; there is no instant
# tombstone), so the router used to keep routing to it — and a mesh RPC to a dead peer has
# no fast connection-refused, so each attempt ate the full per-attempt timeout. The fix
# (mycelium-reason/src/route.rs): InferenceRouter now filters candidates to live SWIM
# members (`peers()`), from which a departed node drops near-instantly on a graceful close
# and within SWIM's detection window otherwise — an order of magnitude faster than
# freshness. So this demo needs NO node-id rigging: A keeps the lower id (7301) and the
# SURVIVOR B has the *higher* id (7302) — exactly the case that used to be slow — and the
