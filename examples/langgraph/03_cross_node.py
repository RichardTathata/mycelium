"""
Rung 3 of the LangGraph example ladder (docs/plans/mycelium-reason-examples.md):
**cross-node resume** — any node resumes any thread (no node failure needed).

Rung 2 proved a checkpoint survives a fresh client on the *same* node. This rung
proves the checkpointer's headline property: a thread checkpointed via node **A**
resumes via node **B**, purely by gossip. No kill, no reheal — just eventual
consistency doing its job. The graph runs partway on A (``interrupt_before`` its
second node), checkpoints, and B — after the thread head has gossiped in —
resumes it to completion. Metadata arrives via gossiped KV; payloads via the
mesh blob fetch (local-then-mesh).

The convergence wait is a **bounded structural poll** (never a fixed sleep as the
mechanism), mirroring the checkpointer's own cross-node test: B must see the same
head id before it may resume.

Run against a two-node reason mesh (A + B, B bootstrapped off A)::

    MYCELIUM_TEST_PORT=8101 MYCELIUM_TEST_PORT_B=8102 \
        python examples/langgraph/03_cross_node.py

Skips cleanly (prints a note, exits 0) when either port is unset.
