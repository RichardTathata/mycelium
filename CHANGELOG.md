## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **`POST /mcp`, `GET /signals/{kind}`, `GET /consensus/{slot}` answered without the gateway
  bearer** — with `gateway_auth_token` set, an unauthenticated caller could invoke **any tool in the
  cluster with the node's own identity** via `tools/call` (provider-side `authorized_callers` sees
  the node, not the HTTP caller), stream live mesh signals, and read committed slot values (lock
  holders). Present in every tagged release with the HTTP gateway; the RBAC page and the wiki listed
  only `/health|/ready|/stats|/metrics` as public. Exposure requires the HTTP listener bound beyond
  loopback (default off, default `127.0.0.1`). Fixed: the three routes now carry the same
  bearer-then-scope layer as `/gateway/*` (external review 2026-09-05, finding 4). **Upgrade note
  for scoped-token deployments:** grant `mcp:invoke` (MCP clients), `mesh:read` (`/signals`),
  `consensus:read` (`/consensus/{slot}`); a legacy `gateway_auth_token` covers all three. Open
  deployments (no token model) are unchanged. `GET /bulk/{id}` stays public by design — a
  capability URL whose 64-bit per-call nonce is the credential, fetched peer-to-peer.

### Fixed

- **`langgraph-checkpoint-mycelium` 0.1.1 — `alist` no longer blocks the event loop.** The
  async checkpoint listing ran the *sync* row-selection driver (`_list_rows`: the `kv/keys` scan
  and one `kv` GET per candidate row on `httpx.Client`), so a large history or a slow gateway
  stalled every other task on the loop; only the payload half was awaited. Row selection is now
  factored into a pure window/filter core with sync and async drivers (`_alist_rows` on
  `httpx.AsyncClient`), gated for parity and for "never touches the sync client" by
  `tests/test_alist_async.py` — which needs no running node (external review 2026-09-05,
  finding 5). Companion package on its own line; no Rust change.
- **Persistence: three P1 durability defects** (external review 2026-09-05, each reproduced by a
  probe before the fix; regression gates in `mycelium-core/src/persistence.rs::durability_tests`).
  Wire unchanged; on-disk format unchanged (`snapshot_hlc` is still written, now informational).
  1. **A snapshot could erase an acknowledged, fsynced write.** The WAL writer acked an append and
     ran its threshold snapshot in the same poll, while `kv_set_async` (and the gossip receive path)
     applied the write to the store only *after* the ack — the store scan lacked the key and the
     WAL record was then truncated. Fixed twice over: every write site now **applies to the store
     before it hands the record to the WAL** (`ops.rs`, `connection.rs`, `mailbox.rs`, gateway
     `kv_write`), and `do_snapshot` **merges the on-disk WAL tail into the snapshot under the store's
     own LWW rule** before truncating, so the persistence layer no longer depends on caller ordering.
  2. **Replay treated HLC timestamps as WAL positions.** `replay` skipped every WAL record with
     `timestamp <= snapshot_hlc`, dropping a delayed remote update (older HLC, accepted after the
     snapshot) even for a key the snapshot lacked. Every record is now replayed; `apply_and_notify`'s
     LWW resolves per key.
  3. **Success reported without durable storage.** `append` (Flush) / `append_sync` /
     `trigger_snapshot` returned `Ok(())` when the writer task was gone (`unwrap_or(Ok(()))`); now
     `BrokenPipe`. `append_sync` documented an unconditional `fdatasync` but only synced in `Flush`
     mode; it now forces the sync in every `SyncMode` (consensus committed slots + leases).
     Consensus discarded the append result: **`ConsensusResult::Committed` gains `persisted: bool`**
     (`false` = committed cluster-wide and applied locally, but not on this node's stable storage;
     logged at `error`), and the gateway's propose / `overlay/consistent/set` responses carry
     `"persisted"` alongside `"ok"`. Additive: all in-tree matchers use `{ .. }`.

## [2.4.1] — 2026-09-04

A **security PATCH** on the 2.4 line. Wire **v12** (`PREV = 11`) unchanged; no public-API change in `mycelium` — a rolling upgrade holds. Companions on their own lines: `mycelium-reason` **0.6.0** (tag `mycelium-reason-v0.6.0`), `mycelium-py` **0.2.3**.

### Security

- **Routes merged via `with_http_routes` answered without the gateway bearer** — every companion
  `/gateway/…` surface (reason, wiki, tuple-space, blackboard) was open even with
  `gateway_auth_token` set, in every tagged release since companion gateway routes existed
  (v2.0.0 →). Fixed: a prefix-guarded auth layer on merged routers + companion **scope families**
  under `compliance`. **Upgrade note for scoped-token deployments:** companion routes now need
  `llm:*` / `wiki:*` / `board:*` / `tuple:*` (or `*`) — see `docs/operations/rbac.md`. Details
  below (Fixed) and in the calibration ledger.
- **wasmtime 46.0.2 → 46.0.3 — RUSTSEC-2026-0269** (trailing-slash sandbox escape; the v2.4.0
  tag ships the vulnerable version). Whole 15-crate wasmtime family moved together.
- **h2 0.4.14 → 0.4.16 — RUSTSEC-2026-0258** (unbounded empty DATA frames).
- **`chacha20` 0.10.0 (yanked) → 0.10.2** — a yanked crate in the lock; `cargo audit` only warns
  on yanks, so it had passed CI (Run 60 finding).


### Added

- **`mycelium-reason` 0.6.0 — three imports from the NVIDIA PAIR comparison (2026-09-04).**
  A same-day comparative read of NVIDIA's Personal AI Router (a per-node inference placer over
  Ollama/LM Studio, Apache-2.0, 3 Sept 2026) against wedge ① found one lesson to take, one
  adoption path to add, and one convention to fix; the position (PAIR is the GPU plane,
  Mycelium the agent plane, stackable) is recorded in `docs/plans/mycelium-reason.md`.
  1. **Local in-flight reservations in `InferenceRouter`** — the pheromone is the provider's
     self-report and lags dispatch by a gossip hop; between our send and its update the only
     evidence a provider is busier is *what we sent it*. Each open call now counts as a
     node-local reservation weighted into the rank (`RouterConfig::reservation_weight`,
     default 0.1; `0.0` restores the old order). Without it N concurrent callers on one node
     read the same stale fill and, via the deterministic id tiebreak, all chose the same
     provider — the thundering herd PAIR documents its reservations against. Never gossiped,
     never a pheromone (lock-order **row 36**). Gate:
     `reservations_spread_concurrent_calls_across_equal_providers` (fails pre-fix). Trace
     `route` events now record `score` (fill + reservations) where they recorded `fill`.
  2. **The OpenAI-compatible façade** — `POST /gateway/reason/v1/chat/completions` +
     `GET /gateway/reason/v1/models`: any OpenAI-speaking client becomes a mesh client by
     changing its base URL (and using the gateway bearer as its API key). `model` is the
     `llm/{model}` capability; same router, reservations and failover as `/route`;
     `stream: true` honoured as a one-chunk SSE stream; OpenAI's error envelope with the
     statuses clients map. The mapping is documented honestly (last user message → `input`;
     `system`/`history` context keys; template-bound `max_tokens`/`temperature`; unknown
     prompt/completion split). `reason_router_with(…, RouterConfig)` tunes the shared router.
     Python CI exercises it from an ordinary HTTP client.
  3. **The `llm-meta` attribute vocabulary + the Ollama collector** — `llm_meta::{CTX_WINDOW,
     FAMILY, ENGINE, WARM, VRAM_USED_MB, VRAM_FREE_MB, TOKENS_PER_SEC, PARAM_SIZE, QUANT}` with
     types and sources fixed so a constraint written on one node matches an ad written on
     another; `ModelProfile::new/with/set`; **`ModelReg::refresh_meta`** re-advertises the
     dynamic attributes, observing the old ad's retraction before publishing the new one
     (the retract-vs-advertise LWW ordering is otherwise a tokio scheduling detail — it held
     in 60 measured flips, so this is explicitness, not a fix). Feature `ollama`: `OllamaProbe` reads `/api/ps` (warm,
     `vram_used_mb`) and `/api/show` (family, ctx window, param size, quant);
     `spawn_meta_refresher` keeps a served model's ad current. Example `ollama_serve`: one
     binary that serves a local Ollama model into the mesh with a live ad and the façade.
     Example **`openai_serve`** (the stacking path): Mycelium over *any* OpenAI-compatible engine
     — PAIR, LM Studio, vLLM, a cloud API — with a static ad; runs deterministically against the
     repo's mock engine (verified two-node, both façades).
     Gates: the collector against a fake daemon; five warm/cold flips each visible within 3 s.

### Fixed

- **Routes merged via `with_http_routes` bypassed the gateway auth boundary** (core, since
  the first companion gateway routes). The auth `route_layer` wrapped only the library's
  nested `/gateway` router; a merged router's `/gateway/reason/route`, `/gateway/wiki/ingest`,
  `/gateway/tuple/put`, … answered **without a bearer** while `/gateway/kv` demanded one — and
  the companions' docs claimed coverage. Found while adding the façade (2026-09-04). Fix: a
  prefix-guarded layer on merged routers — `/gateway/…` paths get the same bearer-then-scope
  check (an unmapped `/gateway/` route is deny-by-default `admin` under `compliance`), paths
  outside stay public (`/.well-known/agent.json`, `/a2a`). Gates in core
  (`test_merged_app_routes_under_gateway_prefix_require_auth`) and in `mycelium-reason`
  (`reason_routes_require_the_gateway_bearer`), both failing pre-fix. Calibration-ledger entry
  (Security scored 8 at Run 59 while this existed). **Scope families for companion routes
  (`compliance`, follow-up the same week):** `required_scope` now maps the merged companion
  paths — `mycelium-reason` to the `llm` family (`/route` and `/v1/chat/completions` ⇒
  `llm:invoke`; trace/blob-GET/`/v1/models` ⇒ `llm:read`; blob PUT ⇒ `llm:write`), and new
  `wiki:*`, `board:*`, `tuple:*` families for the wiki, blackboard, and tuple-space routes.
  Exact paths only: an unlisted companion path stays deny-by-default `admin`. *Behaviour note
  for scoped-token deployments:* companion routes that were (wrongly) open now need these
  family scopes or `*`. Gate: `test_scoped_tokens_on_merged_companion_routes`; runbook
  `docs/operations/rbac.md`.
- **`mycelium-py` connection-reuse gate: the parked-takes test was timing-based** — it sampled
  the stub's connection count at a fixed 1 s and read 88/120 on a hosted runner (CI red on a
  docs-only commit, 2026-09-04). Now polls the count to its plateau inside a 5 s park window
  before any take returns; the pre-fix pool still plateaus at exactly 100.
- **`mycelium-py` 0.2.0: persistent pooled HTTP client** — the bridge opened a fresh TCP
  connection per gateway call, exhausting macOS ephemeral ports at Group-scale write rates
  (~16k rapid KV calls; found by a downstream test session). All request/response call sites now
  share loop-aware persistent keep-alive clients (`mycelium/_pool.py`); SSE streams stay
  dedicated. New: `MyceliumAgent.close()/aclose()` + context-manager support, `aclose()` on the
  companion clients. Gate: `tests/test_connection_reuse.py` (fails on pre-fix code).
- **`mycelium-py` 0.2.1: pooling fixes from the 2026-09-02 360° review** — three sites the 0.2.0
  conversion missed or got wrong: `TupleSpace.take`/`take_by_key` (the worker hot loop — one
  connection per claimed item) and `MyceliumAgent.set_with_min_acks` now ride the pool with
  per-borrow timeouts; `ClientPool` eviction now checks *loop liveness* instead of evicting every
  non-current loop's client (two threads each running a live loop no longer degrade each other to
  fresh clients per borrow) and all pool-map access is lock-guarded. The connection-reuse gate now
  also runs in CI and covers all three — one targeted test per fix, each proven to fail on the
  pre-fix code (the two-thread test alongside them is a concurrency smoke, not a gate).

- **`mycelium-py` 0.2.2: one client-lifecycle pattern** — `PromptSkillClient`, `ReasonClient`,
  and `A2aClient` migrate onto `ClientPool` (prompt-skill/reason handles previously built an
  eager `AsyncClient` in `__init__`, loop-bound on first use — a second `asyncio.run()` against
  the same handle failed; regression-gated). `ClientPool` grows the SDK-wide `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`
  (one literal instead of three) and the `PoolOwner` mixin (one `aclose()` definition for
  Wiki/TupleSpace/Blackboard). A2A's SSE `stream()` stays dedicated, per the streaming policy.

- **`mycelium-py` 0.2.3: no connection cap on pooled long-polls** — the second 360° pass
  (2026-09-03) caught a regression of the first's fix: pooling `take()` put parked workers under
  httpx's default `max_connections=100`, so a fleet with >100 tasks parked on one handle had its
  101st take queued behind the pool (worst case `httpx.PoolTimeout`) instead of parked at the
  server; the per-call clients never capped concurrency and now neither does the pool
  (`Limits(max_connections=None, max_keepalive_connections=None)`; gate: 120 concurrent parked
  takes must all hold a connection — exactly 100 did before). Also `emit_reliable` now borrows
  with `timeout_secs + 5.0` like every other server-parked call (pre-existing: a `timeout_secs`
  at or above the client timeout raised `ReadTimeout` instead of returning `"timeout"`).

### Changed

- **`GitStore`: one ref-CAS retry driver** — the 32-attempt/backoff/`Conflict` retry skeleton
  that `write_with`, `write_pages`, and `remove_page` each hand-rolled now lives once
  (`with_ref_cas`), so the contention policy (already retuned once, P6.4) has a single home.
  No behavior change.

### Fixed

- **`FsStore`: erase-vs-write serialization** — a `remove_page` racing a concurrent
  `write_page`/apply in the same process could leave a persistent torn page (a recreated manifest
  surviving the erasure with its section objects deleted). All FsStore mutators now serialize
  through a flat leaf mutex (`FsStore::mutate`, lock-order row 35); per-object CAS remains the
  cross-process backstop and erasure stays idempotent. Tripwire:
  `concurrent_erase_and_write_never_leave_a_torn_page`.
- **`mycelium-wiki`: the erase verb** — `WikiStore::remove_page(page, label)` (a default trait
  method that **fails closed**; implementors: `FsStore` deletes the object bytes strictly,
  `GitStore` commits a **redaction at tip** — history retained by design, per the git-as-truth
  envelope) and the curator-authorized `Wiki::erase_page` (curator-local; deliberately not a mesh
  RPC or gateway route). Completes the store-as-truth right-to-erasure story: erase in the record
  via the same single-writer path as every write, then the projection step
  (`GitMirror` delete + `rebuild()`) per `docs/operations/data-erasure.md`. Found as a gap in the
  2026-08-16 Novus-i2 (org-twin) applicability assessment.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-08-16

Wire **v12** (PREV 11) — unchanged since v2.0.0; a fully backwards-compatible rolling upgrade
(rolling-upgrade + prev-wire gates green). The **wiki-substrate MINOR**: everything here is
additive, dominated by the council-wiki substrate arc — the git-as-truth `GitStore` with its
six-phase hardening (two recorded measurements), the `GitMirror` projection sink, the claim-check
bulk-ingest stack with an HTTP edge + SDK verbs, and the pluggable `PageFormat` codec. Design
records: `docs/design/wiki-git-store.md` · `docs/design/transparency-council-substrate.md` ·
`docs/plans/council-substrate-hardening.md`.

**Security note:** this is the **first tagged release carrying the wasmtime RUSTSEC-2026-0222
fix** (46.0.2) — the v2.3.0 tag was cut from a lineage that predated the 2026-07-16 bump and
ships wasmtime 45.0.3 with that low-severity (3.8) advisory open; upgrade rather than build the
v2.3.0 tag with the `wasm` feature in hardened environments.

### Added
- **`mycelium-wiki` `GitStore` — the git-as-truth `WikiStore`** (feature `git-store`, zero added
  dependencies): pages are real markdown files in a git checkout, every write a commit behind an
  atomic `update-ref` branch-head CAS (plumbing against a private temporary index — the caller's
  staging is never touched; commits carry only the written path, so the scoped-commit discipline is
  the mechanism, not a rule). CAS tokens are content hashes that never appear in the document,
  preserving per-section CAS independence inside the one-file-per-page layout; bodies round-trip
  byte-exactly; reads are at HEAD, never the working tree. Built **only for deployments inside the
  E1–E4 eligibility envelope** of `docs/design/wiki-git-store.md` — Phase 1 of the
  Transparency-Platform council-wiki substrate (`docs/design/transparency-council-substrate.md`).
  Gates: `tests/git_store.rs` (the FsStore contract suite mirrored, 20 tests, incl. a two-instance
  ref-CAS race) + `tests/git_store_curator.rs` (a curator draining proposals into scoped, prefixed
  git commits). **Phase-2 wiring:** `GitStoreConfig::for_group` — the group-per-council convention
  made executable (one repo, one store per group, `councils/{group}` scope; gate: two curators, two
  councils, one repo, concurrent applies, no cross-scope commits). **Phase-6 hardening (all
  M-side items):** batch commits (`write_pages` — one commit per meeting batch, whole-batch-atomic
  gate refusal, the validator runs once per batch with the file list); the corpus-scale read plane
  (persistent `cat-file --batch` child — measured 330 ms for list+query over 600 pages);
  pull-on-promote/push-per-round failover (`refresh`/`publish` default trait methods; a curator
  that cannot refresh never serves; worktree-free **subtree-splice** publish that needs no merge
  base; divergence tripwire); jittered exponential backoff + the measured ten-council contention
  run (5.5/3.0 batches/s shared/deployed, zero spurious failures — the gate surfaced and fixed
  four real defects incl. a cross-instance temp-index collision); the pluggable **`PageFormat`**
  codec (a deployment.s own entity format plugs in — proven end-to-end with a custom codec);
  `submit_batch_with_timeout` + the batch=one-meeting sizing contract; blocking-pool offload for
  ingest/publish. **Phase-3 write gate:**
  `GitStoreConfig::validate_cmd` — a deployment command (e.g. the council-wiki Node validator) run
  pre-commit over the candidate file; nonzero exit refuses with findings
  (`WikiError::gate_refusal`, carried inside `Io` — no new enum variant), worktree restored, no
  commit; the curator **drops** refused proposals (never retries — the queue can't wedge) and
  counts them via `Wiki::gate_refusals()`. **Phase-4 bulk ingest:** the claim-check path —
  `IngestBatch`/`BatchSource` (`FsBatchSource` ref impl; S3 = deployment impl), pure deterministic
  `apply_batch` (byte-identical git trees vs a serial writer, idempotent resubmit), and the
  membership-gated `wiki.{group}.ingest` RPC + `Wiki::submit_batch` — the reference rides the RPC,
  the payload never rides the mesh or KV. **Phase-5 work distribution:** assembly-only — tuple-space
  council leases × idempotent ingest = **exactly-once effect** across two companions (gate: worker
  dies after submit before ack; redelivered lease re-submits in full; zero duplicate
  commits/leaves).
- **`mycelium-wiki` change sinks — git as a projection of the store** (feature `git-mirror`): a
  `ChangeSink` on the `CuratorBrain` is notified after each applied drain round (best-effort, never
  load-bearing); the shipped `GitMirror` renders touched pages as pure markdown (no CAS tokens) into
  a git worktree — **one commit per round** with proposal provenance — and optionally pushes to an
  operator remote, `EgressPolicy`-gated **fail-closed** with a post-push `ls-remote` divergence
  tripwire (`push_divergences()`). `rebuild()` regenerates the whole mirror from the store (also the
  erasure procedure's second step). Zero new dependencies (the `git` CLI). Deliberately **not** a
  `GitStore` backing store — a branch ref is a global sequencer and git history forfeits erasability;
  the rejected as-truth variant is retained behind an eligibility envelope in
  `docs/design/wiki-git-store.md`. Gates: `mycelium-wiki/tests/git_mirror.rs` (5 tests) + the CI Wiki
  job's `git-mirror` steps. Runbooks: `operations/companions.md` § git mirror ·
  `operations/data-erasure.md` (projection retention) · cookbook recipe.

### Security
- **wasmtime 45 → 46 (RUSTSEC-2026-0222,** "Stores can mix up type indices between engines", low)
  in `mycelium-wasm-host` — the 45.x line received no patched release, so this is a major bump
  (lock: 46.0.2; source-compatible, zero code changes). The 46 tree raises the crate's MSRV
  `rust-version` 1.88 → **1.94** (CI pins 1.96.0; `examples/coop` inherits the floor only under its
  opt-in `wasm` feature).

## [2.3.0] — 2026-07-24

Wire **v12** (PREV 11) — unchanged; a fully backwards-compatible rolling upgrade. This is the
**SOC 2 audit-gap release**: the five gaps a pentest / SOC 2 control walkthrough surfaces in an
adopter's audit are closed, with an adopter-facing shared-responsibility matrix as the spine
(`docs/plans/soc2-audit-gap-closure.md`, `docs/operations/shared-responsibility-matrix.md`). Pure
library — no daemon, no control plane; your deployment is the audited system. Additive public API
throughout, so a minor bump. Also the release-1 (R1) step of the identity Phase-3 rollout:
`require_identity_proofs` ships **default-off** — enable it only after the whole fleet runs this
release.

### Added

- **Native gateway TLS (WS-A):** `GossipConfig::gateway_tls` (`GatewayTlsConfig`) — server-side
  HTTPS on the gateway port (reuse the node cert or supply a hostname cert) so bearer tokens/JWTs
  aren't cleartext. Plaintext + front-with-proxy remains the default.
- **Audit export (WS-C):** `AuditSink` trait + `GossipAgent::with_audit_sink` — every sealed record
  mirrored to your SIEM/WORM off the write path; the in-cluster chain stays authoritative.
- **Audit retention (WS-D):** signed `AuditCheckpoint` (`sys/audit-checkpoint/`) +
  `audit_checkpoint` / `audit_prune_to_checkpoint` — export then prune old records while the rest
  still verifies (verify-from-checkpoint).
- **Compromise remediation (WS-B):** `rotate_identity_on_compromise` + operator route
  `POST /gateway/identity/revoke` (scope `identity:write`).
- **`sys/identity` authentication (WS-E):** CA-cert anchor harvest + `identity_anchor_conflicts`
  tripwire, signed `sys/identity-proof/` (reject an overwrite not chained to a trusted key), and
  the `require_identity_proofs` flag (reject unsigned; `GOSSIP_REQUIRE_IDENTITY_PROOFS`). Closes the
  forged-consensus-quorum vector.
- **GDPR erasure (WS-F):** `SubjectKeyRegistry` crypto-shred helper (`mycelium::SubjectKeyRegistry`,
  `tls`) — per-subject DEK; erase = destroy the key.

### Changed

- `make check` now clippies the `compliance` feature (compliance-gated code was previously
  un-linted locally); three CI gates added (compliance suite, consensus-free embed, core clippy).
- New direct deps `ring` (mycelium-core, `tls`), `hyper-util` + `tower-service` (`gateway`) — all
  already present transitively, so no new compiled crate.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-07-16

Wire **v12** (PREV 11) — unchanged from v2.1.0; a fully backwards-compatible rolling upgrade
(rolling-upgrade + prev-wire gates green). This release is dominated by a **five-pass adversarial
self-audit** (`docs/analysis/ratings.md`, Runs 50–58): ~40 correctness fixes across the consensus,
gossip, membership, persistence, gateway, and companion surfaces, plus a structural input-fuzz gate.
The minor bump reflects a small amount of additive public API and one behaviour change (`/ready`).

### Fixed

**Consensus & convergence (audit passes 1–2).**
- **Cross-group quorum split-brain on even N** — `cross_group_quorum` had no `N/2+1` floor, so two
  disjoint quorums could each commit. Now floored; gate `regression_even_n_quorum_intersects`.
- **`elect_leader` / overlay-elect split-brain** — returned the local node id on `Committed` without
  re-reading the LWW-converged slot; two racing proposers both "won". Now converge-then-reread.
- **Acceptor equivocation** — a voter could vote for a *second* value at the same ballot; two
  proposers could both commit different values at one ballot. Fixed (`may_cast_vote`); gate
  `regression_voter_never_accepts_two_values_at_one_ballot`.
- **Vote double-count** — `cross_propose` counted a re-delivered vote twice toward quorum. Per-voter
  `seen` set.
- **Vote impersonation** — signed consensus verified the signer but not that the `voter`/`proposer`
  named *inside* the message was that signer; one key could forge N votes. Now bound
  (`signer_authorized`). **Key revocation is now applied on the consensus verify path** too.
- **Lease clock-domain** — lease liveness compared a reader's wall clock against the writer's HLC
  physical (two domains); skewed nodes could both hold a `distributed_lock`. Now `causal_now_ms` at
  all lease-read sites; the fencing token (commit HLC) remains the correctness guard.

**Anti-entropy, HLC & store.**
- **Value-blind anti-entropy digest** — the digest folded `hash(key) ^ timestamp` only, so two nodes
  holding the same `(key, HLC)` with *different bytes* were certified converged → permanent silent
  divergence. Now folds the value hash; gates `regression_anti_entropy_digest_reflects_value` +
  incremental-matches-recompute.
- **HLC monotonicity** — `tick()` was not strictly monotonic at logical saturation, and a poisoned
  `observe(u64::MAX)` under `max_drift_ms=0` could wrap the clock to 0 via the `pack` left-shift. Both
  fixed (carry-into-physical; `pack`/carry saturate at `PHYS_MAX`).
- **Store live-entry cap** — the `max_store_entries` gate counted tombstones and dropped overwrites,
  freezing a stale value that anti-entropy re-dropped every round (permanent divergence). Now an exact
  inline live count + overwrite exemption.
- **`grp_generation` published before its index**; **`append()` same-ms cross-node key collision**;
  **`KvHandle` log-consumer `offset + 1` overflow** — all fixed (`Acquire`/`Release`, node-salted keys,
  `saturating_add`).

**Membership, connection & persistence.**
- **SWIM self-incarnation overflow/wrap** — a self-`Suspect`/`Dead` rumour at `u64::MAX` (an
  unauthenticated UDP datagram) panicked the listener (overflow-checks) or wrapped to 0 (release),
  getting a live node evicted cluster-wide. Now `saturating_add`.
- **Self-peering** — a spoofed/reflected Ping carrying a node's own id made it peer with itself. Guarded.
- **Writer reap/evict orphaned a re-claimed live writer** (leaked task + double connection). Now
  compute-with-recheck + atomic remove-and-signal.
- **Snapshot dropped tombstones** → deleted keys resurrected across a restart (a stale peer's ancient
  value won LWW against an absent entry). Snapshot now retains in-window tombstones.

**Gateway, rate, opacity & diagnostics.**
- **Unauthenticated node-abort inputs** — `gw_kv_quorum`'s `Duration::from_secs_f64(negative)` and
  `parse_hex32`'s non-char-boundary slice both panicked (a node abort under the release `panic=abort`).
  Now validated → `400`.
- **JWT `aud`/`iss` bypass** — tokens *omitting* the claim passed (jsonwebtoken validates only when
  present); an audience-confusion path to the `*` grant. Now `set_required_spec_claims`.
- **Rate-aggregate overflow** (a forged `sys/rate/` value) — panic or a rate-limit *bypass* on wrap.
  Saturating.
- **Unclamped peer `fill_ratio`** → a `~584M-year` consensus retry sleep. Clamped to `[0,1]` at decode.
- **Signal reorder buffer was inert** — `flush_expired` force-drained the whole buffer, so
  `signal_ordered_delivery` delivered out of order and dropped reordered signals. Now honours
  `max_hold`/`max_depth`.
- **Boundary push-path ignored LWW** (transient wrong Group admission); **`gw_signal_emit` widened an
  unknown scope to cluster-wide**; **`overlay_group_propose` double-counted self** in the quorum;
  **`gw_overlay_log_subscribe` `hlc + 1` overflow** and a **group-subscribe idle-disconnect task+claim
  leak**; **`commit_conflict_slots` unbounded/ungated**; **`opaque_node_pct` false storm**;
  **`system_stats().store_entries` read a stale counter**; **live `TimingIntent` skipped `validate()`**
  (a fleet-wide health-loop stall) — all fixed + (where unit-testable) gated.

**Companions & examples.**
- **Blackboard startup-lag split-brain + single-shot sync** — ported the tuple-space promotion guard
  (`seen_primary` + orphan grace) and the join-time backfill retry it never received.
- **`mycelium-reason` trace replay** — the pass-1 `append`-key salt (`log/{stream}/{hlc}/{node}`) broke
  reason's own `log/`-key parser, silently dropping every trace event (CI-red until caught). Fixed +
  `trace_record_replay_round_trips` gate.

### Added

- **Input-fuzz gate (no panic on untrusted input)** — a suite of proptests that run under
  overflow-checks in `cargo test`, so unchecked arithmetic on a gossiped/config value fails the build:
  `store::fuzz_apply_observe_tick_never_panics`, `config::fuzz_validate_never_panics`,
  `capability::fuzz_is_fresh_never_panics`, `rate::fuzz_reconcile_throttle_never_panics`,
  `hlc::observe_then_tick_never_wraps`, `swim_membership::fuzz_apply_never_panics_on_arbitrary_update`,
  plus the nightly cargo-fuzz `frame_apply` decode→process target.
- **Identity-authentication — Phase 1a** (`tls::ed25519_key_from_cert_der`): extract a peer's
  CA-authenticated Ed25519 key from its validated cert (the anchor for the phased fix of the
  `sys/identity` poisoning gap, designed in `docs/design/identity-authentication.md`). Zero new
  dependency.
- **`Blackboard::is_primary()` / `is_secondary()`** — public role introspection (tuple-space parity).

### Changed

- **`/ready` now reflects startup completion, not soft-state advertisement.** A node that advertises no
  capability (a pure KV/signal node) is ready once `start()` completes, instead of returning `503`
  forever — it was previously undeployable behind a Kubernetes readiness gate. Capability discovery
  gossips independently and no longer gates readiness.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-07-15

Wire **v12** (PREV 11) — unchanged from v2.0.0; a fully backwards-compatible rolling upgrade.

### Added
- **`LockService` — the distributed-lock service** (`agent.consensus().locks()`): the ergonomic
  layer over `distributed_lock` with **blocking acquire** (`lock(name, ttl, wait)` waits out
  contention instead of failing immediately) and a **scoped critical section**
  (`with_lock(...)`, release guaranteed on every exit path). Ships with a runnable
  `examples/distributed_lock.rs` (three nodes contend + fence a resource), a when-to-use table
  (lock vs work-queue vs leader-election vs consistent_set), and the leased-lock/fencing-token
  discipline in guide ch. 04. Gates: `lock_blocks_then_acquires_when_freed`,
  `with_lock_releases_after_section`, `lock_times_out_while_held`.
- **Lock fencing token is now the commit HLC, not the ballot** (found by the new example): the
  ballot regresses under gossip lag (a later holder could get a *lower* token, wrongly fencing a
  legitimate write), so `LockGuard::token` is now the winning commit's HLC — **monotonic across
  successive holders**. Gate: `fencing_token_is_monotonic_across_acquisitions`. The gateway
  returns it as a decimal **string** (the HLC exceeds JS safe-integer range; the TS SDK already
  expected a string, the Python SDK parses it to `int`).
- **`GossipAgent::connect_peer` / `disconnect_peer`** — pin (and actively warm) a direct
  forwarding route to an RPC-heavy peer. The forwarding-target set deliberately de-pins
  non-active peers (seed scalability), which silently degrades Individual-scoped
  request-response RPC to flood-relay latency; a pin survives every target rebuild, and the
  call also spawns the writer + sends a Ping so the connection is established *ahead* of the
  first RPC rather than on its deadline. The tuple-space pins both directions (secondary
  warm-keeper + primary heartbeat). First half of the integration-S13 CI flake (#150, #155).
- **Docker cluster suites are CI-gated** (`cluster-suites.yml`): `make test` (13 integration
  scenarios, 4-node) + `make test-overlay` (S11–S13, 3-node) run on substrate PRs
  (path-filtered), merges to main, nightly, and on demand — no retries by design. Wiring this
  gate is what surfaced both #150 root causes. Harness hardening alongside: scenario ERR trap
  (a red scenario names its dying line), S13 take-loop HTTP-code instrumentation, node-log
  dump on runner failure, and a Phase-0 data-plane readiness barrier (#156). A self-hosted
  nightly for the 100-node scale suites is staged separately (#157).
- **Examples & docs, substantially reworked** — a single faceted **capability matrix** as the
  examples front door (every example fingerprinted by stack layer + facet — level · surface · LLM ·
  audit · metrics — each linking to its run-doc); the artifact library made **watchable** with two new
  browser showcases (`provisioning_viz` — a capability self-provisions then heals onto a standby with
  no coordinator; `catalog_viz` — the origin dies + its library is deleted, yet a late node installs
  from a verified peer cache); a `## Loads` banner on every runtime-loading demo declaring **what it
  installs** (content · type · source); a **UI-example contract** standardising every browser demo
  (gateway+metrics, an Ops Console two-way link, a "what you're seeing" concepts box); and
  `docs/philosophy.html` ported to a GitHub-readable **`philosophy.md`** as the single canonical source.

### Fixed
- **`distributed_lock` is now a correct mutually-exclusive, releasable lock** (#164). Two
  execution-confirmed bugs: (A) acquire returned on its *local optimistic* consensus commit
  without confirming the LWW-converged holder, so two racers both got a guard (no mutual
  exclusion — reproduced `winners == 2`); (B) release tombstoned the plain key `lock/{name}`
  while the authoritative lock lives at `consensus/committed/lock/{name}`, so release was a
  no-op and a lock, once taken, was **permanently unreleasable**. Fixes (the #151 converged-
  holder discipline): the value is `{holder}:{nonce}` with a real consensus **lease** derived
  from `ttl` (the old `expires_ms` field was never enforced); acquire confirms the converged
  value before returning a guard (losers get `Superseded`); release clears the authoritative
  slot + lease, guarded so a stale guard (lease lapsed / another acquire won / same node
  re-acquired) can never clear the live holder's claim. The HTTP gateway lock
  (`POST /gateway/overlay/lock/acquire`) had the same three bugs and gets the same fix. Gates:
  `distributed_lock_grants_single_holder_under_race`,
  `distributed_lock_release_frees_for_reacquire`,
  `distributed_lock_stale_release_does_not_clobber` (all verified failing pre-fix). Coarse-
  grained by design: a consensus round per acquire, ~1 s to let the commit converge.
- **Self-targeted Individual signals no longer flood the cluster**: a frame whose target is
  the local node (a self-emit like mailbox deliver-to-self, or a relayed frame arriving at
  its destination) terminated locally but still entered the forward path — no route to self
  → cluster-wide flood until seen-set/TTL killed it, plus a misleading topology-pressure
  warn naming the node itself and spurious `individual_flood_fallbacks` counts. The gossip
  shard now terminates Individual frames addressed to itself (admission already delivered
  them; this is routing, not scope admission). Found diagnosing #161's node logs. Gate:
  `self_targeted_signal_does_not_flood` (verified failing pre-fix).
- **All tuple-space pipeline ops wait for capability discovery** (`mycelium-tuple-space`):
  `put`/`put_keyed`/`take_by_key`/`complete_keyed`/`ack` failed `NoProvider` *instantly*
  when issued before the primary's advertisement propagated, while `take`/`complete` waited
  (#154 fixed only the read side) — analysis Run 41's API-design finding. All pipeline ops
  now resolve via the bounded blocking path (`BackpressureMode::Raise` means "don't block on
  a *saturated* primary", not "race capability gossip"); `depth` deliberately stays
  fail-fast — it is the discovery probe monitors poll. Gate:
  `client_ops_wait_for_discovery_under_default_config` (verified failing pre-fix).
- **HTTP listener sets `SO_REUSEADDR`**: a fast process restart on a fixed port could hit
  `AddrInUse` from lingering TIME_WAIT tuples and panic the node at `agent.start()` — the
  gossip listener always set it; the HTTP bind did not. Timing-dependent, so fast hardware
  never saw it; a CPU-starved CI runner did (scenario 03's restart killed node-a and 11
  downstream scenarios — named directly by the gate's node-log dump).
- **Tuple-space late-joining secondary now backfills** (`mycelium-tuple-space`): live
  replication only ships records put while a secondary is present, so a secondary joining an
  established (or promoted) primary held a *partial* mirror — a succession chain (A dies → B
  promotes → C joins → B dies) silently lost the pre-join backlog while redundancy *looked*
  restored. A joining secondary now drives the paginated `wal_replay` RPC (WAL primary → WAL
  pages; transient primary → new *state chunks*: live items as `Put` records with id-cursor
  pagination); the mirror's idempotent apply dedupes overlap with concurrent replication.
  Gate: `succession_chain_late_secondary_joins_promoted_primary`, which also executes the
  full ring-driven succession topology (late C pins promoted B, client ops through C,
  C's own second-generation promotion).
- **Tuple-space spurious promotion on startup lag** (`mycelium-tuple-space`): the promotion
  watch treated *never-saw-a-primary* as *primary-evaporated*, so on a CPU-starved host a
  freshly-started secondary promoted on cap-propagation lag — and, never demoting, held a
  permanent split-brain (takes 408 off the impostor's empty mirror while puts landed on the
  real primary; the hosted-CI integration-S13 signature). "Evaporated" now requires prior
  sight; never-seen promotes only after a 10-interval orphan grace (bounded availability).
  Canary-verified gates: `secondary_startup_lag_is_not_evaporation`,
  `never_seen_primary_promotes_after_orphan_grace` (#150, #158).

### Changed
- **Operations docs pass** (same DX lens, 2026-07-10): the topology-pressure warn /
  `connect_peer` / `individual_flood_fallbacks` — this week's new operator surface — gained
  runbook coverage (`tuning.md` §RPC-heavy pairs + `observability.md` counter docs with the
  remedy link); the restructure's config-table append was merged into tuning's canonical
  quick-reference (env-var precedence note + 10 missing fields) instead of duplicating it;
  `/stats` docs now list all tripwire + liveness counters.
- **Docs restructure for third-party DX** (front-page audit, 2026-07-10): `README.md` cut from
  **1,604 → 192 lines** — it is now a true front page (hero, 30-second hello, demos, build/run,
  a layers-at-a-glance table, pointers) and the ~1,100 lines of subsystem reference moved to
  their owning pages as clearly-marked "Reference —" sections (guide ch. 00/01/02/03/04/05/13,
  cookbook, `operations/tuning.md` — which gains the performance baselines + `GossipConfig`
  reference). One home per fact; nothing deleted. Examples fixes alongside: five orphan
  examples indexed (`conway`, `invoke_skill`, `semantic_coordination`, + the two paper
  runners), `conway-gpu/` gains a README, `coop/` gains Objective/How-to-run + the missing
  `reheal_deploy` (M+) block and honest counts (**14 demos: 12 CI + 2 manual** — was
  "eleven"/"12"), the guide's duplicate example table now defers to the canonical
  `examples/README.md` index, and a long-dead `#durability-contract` link in ch. 12 was
  found and repointed.
- **Internal: spawn-task context structs + the `kv.rs` fossil split** (analysis Run 42's
  Conceptual Integrity warts, validated then fixed). `run_gossip_shard` (20 positional
  params), `run_health_monitor` (24), and `run_gc_task` (13) now take
  `GossipShardContext`/`HealthMonitorContext`/`GcContext` — the codebase's own
  `ListenerContext` idiom, applied consistently. Field-name initialization eliminates the
  silent same-typed positional-swap class (`dropped_frames`/`individual_flood_fallbacks` and
  `backoff`/`idle_timeout` were adjacent identical types), and the next field addition is one
  struct line instead of a multi-file positional thread. `src/agent/kv.rs` — which contained
  zero KV methods (its name was a fossil from the v2 M3 core migration) — is split by concern
  into `topology.rs` (peers, connect_peer/disconnect_peer, groups, drop counts) and
  `introspect.rs` (identity, hot tunables, govern_timing, readiness, system_stats, fleet
  views). Pure mechanical moves: no public API, behavior, wire, or lock changes.
- **`InferenceRouter` is now robust to dead nodes** (`mycelium-reason`): routing candidates
  are filtered to live SWIM members (`GossipAgent::peers()`, plus self), so a departed node
  is dropped an order of magnitude faster than the ~90s capability-freshness window; and a
  new `RouterConfig::failover_timeout` (default 8s) caps non-final attempts, so a candidate
  that died inside the failure-detection window costs ~8s to fail over past, not the full
  30s inference budget (the last/lone candidate still gets `call_timeout`). Surfaced by the
  deploy/reheal flagship, which consequently drops its node-id rigging — the surviving node
  can hold either id. Canary: `liveness_filter_drops_a_non_peer_cap`.
- **Run-39 floor fixes (test architecture + observability).** The core's bind-verified,
  process-unique loopback port allocator (`test_util::alloc_port`, confined below the OS ephemeral
  floor) is now exposed under a new **test-only `test-util` cargo feature** and adopted by every
  companion's real-agent integration tests (`mycelium::test_util::alloc_port()` replaces the
  per-crate `free_port` bind-`:0`-read-drop helper) — retiring the `AddrInUse` TOCTOU flake class
  at the source instead of only at the CI retry tier. And `mycelium-reason`/`mycelium-guardrails`
  gained `metrics`-facade counters (route attempts/failovers/no-provider/exhausted; guardrail
  denials-sealed/admits) so inference failovers and Tier-C denials are visible on `/metrics`
  (no-op without a recorder). The `test-util` feature carries no runtime deps and never enters a
  production build.

### Added
- **Example-doc standard + index ([`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md)).** The example READMEs
  had drifted into three names for the same section and re-typed setup in each file; there was no
  index. Now: a front-door index of every example, one **shared-setup** section (Rust / Ollama /
  Python / Docker), and a **doc template** (`Objective` · `How to run` · `What it demonstrates` ·
  `Dev notes`; single-example + suite variants sharing one per-example block). The five drifted
  READMEs (`chat`, `fluid_pipeline`, `a2a_langchain`, `community`, `langgraph`) were normalized to it,
  duplicated setup replaced by a link, and each given verified concept + mechanism links; the root
  README's ~160-line embedded demo walkthroughs (which duplicated `examples/`) collapsed to a
  pointer table (1742 → ~1605 lines). `coop/` is the reference suite shape.
- **Reference Kubernetes deployment ([`deploy/kubernetes/`](deploy/kubernetes/)).** The multi-host
  cluster `deployment.md` describes, now shipped as ready-to-apply manifests: a seed StatefulSet +
  headless Service, a horizontally-scalable worker StatefulSet bootstrapping to the seed's stable
  pod DNS (namespace-correct via downward-API env expansion), `/ready`+`/health` probes, `/metrics`
  scrape annotations, and a management dashboard. `kubectl apply -k deploy/kubernetes`, then
  `kubectl scale statefulset mycelium-worker --replicas=N`. This is the structural escape from the
  single-host Docker-bridge iptables ceiling (`scale-tests.md`): on a multi-node cluster the pods
  spread across hosts, so the O(N²) chain never forms on any one host. Cloud-agnostic (same
  manifests on kind / EKS / GKE / AKS). Validated offline (`kubectl kustomize` → 7 well-formed
  resources); not applied in CI — see [`deploy/kubernetes/README.md`](deploy/kubernetes/README.md).
- **Reference Terraform for the cluster ([`deploy/terraform/`](deploy/terraform/)).** Closes the
  cluster-provisioning gap the manifests assume: `aws/` stands up **EKS + ECR** (via the
  `terraform-aws-modules` VPC/EKS modules), `gcp/` stands up a regional **GKE cluster + Artifact
  Registry**. Full path becomes `terraform apply` → push image → `kubectl apply -k`. Reference
  scaffolding, not hardened product IaC (single node group, public endpoint, local state).
  Authored against AWS/Google provider `~> 5.0` + EKS module `~> 20.0`; **not machine-validated**
  (no `terraform` binary in the authoring env) and **not applied** (needs cloud creds) — run
  `terraform validate && terraform plan` before apply. See [`deploy/terraform/README.md`](deploy/terraform/README.md).
- **Operator docs: metrics reference + audit/transparency tail.** New
  [`docs/operations/metrics.md`](docs/operations/metrics.md) is the single, complete reference for
  every emitted Prometheus series (gossip · emergent · governor · artifact · guardrails · reason),
  wired into `observability.md`; the shipped Grafana dashboard gains emergent/guardrails/reason
  panels; `audit.md` documents `/gateway/transparency` revocation proofs and proving a guardrail
  stopped an agent; `deployment.md` gains a backup/restore note; the operations index gains a
  "Start here" funnel.
- **`mycelium-guardrails`** (new companion crate, PR 1 — the policy API; strategy + code-verified
  bindings in [`docs/plans/mycelium-guardrails.md`](docs/plans/mycelium-guardrails.md)): a
  self-imposed, **tier-labelled** structural-guardrail declaration on the public API only. One
  `Policy` compiles to boundary groups (Tier A), `AgentPolicy` transition guards (Tier B), and
  provider-side `authorized_callers` (Tier C — hard prevention); `Policy::strength_report()`
  discloses which clause is hard-prevented vs self-imposed vs detection. `apply()` configures
  **this** node (no remote policy authority); under `compliance`, `check_caller`/`guarded_rpc_serve`
  gate a served RPC and **seal** each `Invoke`/`Denied` into the tamper-evident audit chain (the
  "prove X was stopped" foundation). The wedge demo, verification tool, and examples are later PRs.
- **`mycelium-guardrails` policy-audit verification tool + worked wedge demo** (PR 2, feature
  `compliance`): `prove_denials`/`narrate_proof` reconstruct a provider's tamper-evident chain and
  prove which unauthorized invocations it sealed as `Invoke`/`Denied` — the honest claim is
  *provable-stopping* (these denials cannot have been forged/reordered/removed without the chain
  failing to verify), **not** a global "X could not have done Y" (the chain is per-node; only gated
  capabilities seal denials). The self-contained `guardrail_wedge` example (an unauthorized agent
  structurally stopped at the provider gate; the proof reconstructed by a neutral observer node) +
  `ci_smoke.sh` earn the wedge at the smoke bar.
- **`mycelium-guardrails` broader worked example + guide chapter 16** (feature `compliance`): the
  self-contained `guardrail_fleet` example composes all three strength tiers in one constructive
  surplus-food-rescue / community-energy co-op fleet and shows each one *actually firing* — a
  region-scoped agent that structurally drops another region's dispatch at its boundary (Tier A), an
  agent refused a denied tool at its `→ Invoking` state transition (Tier B), and an unauthorized
  caller rejected + sealed + proven at a settlement provider (Tier C); `ci_smoke.sh` now gates both
  demos. (Guide chapter 16 · Guardrails is already committed on this branch.)
- **`mycelium-reason`** (new companion crate; strategy + code-verified bindings in
  [`docs/plans/mycelium-reason.md`](docs/plans/mycelium-reason.md)): the v3.0 Tier-3
  differentiators on the public API only — **capability-routed inference**
  (`serve_model`/`InferenceRouter`: model-is-a-prompt-skill `llm/{model}` + attributed
  `llm-meta/{model}` ad; resolve → drop opaque → rank by pheromone fill → failover),
  **fleet-reasoning traces** (`TraceRecorder`/`replay`/`narrate` on per-node log
  substreams `reason/{run_id}/{node}`, optional audit-chain anchoring under
  `compliance`), **artifact-aware resume** (demand half: `require_model` +
  structural `await_ready` + `llm/loading` progress), and the content-addressed
  blob tier (`FsBlobStore`/`MeshBlobStore`/`spawn_blob_server`, ≤ 8 MiB single-frame
  v1) with `/gateway/reason/{blob,trace}` routes for the LangGraph checkpointer.
- **Reason routing gateway + Python client**: `POST /gateway/reason/route`
  (`InferenceRouter`-backed — load-aware, failover; the mesh-native counterpart to
  single-shot `/gateway/llm/call`) and `mycelium.ReasonClient` in `mycelium-py`
  (`route`/`trace`/`blob_put`/`blob_get`), unblocking a load-aware, failover LLM node
  for the LangGraph ladder (rung 4).
- **The deploy/reheal flagship (rung 6, echo variant)** — `mycelium-reason`'s
  `reheal_node` example (`SERVE_MODEL` publishes a content-addressed model artifact +
  advertises its id in KV; `REHEAL` declares the demand via `require_model`, fetches the
  artifact over the mesh with `MeshBlobStore`, and bridges it into a live `serve_model`
  skill) plus a self-contained Python driver `examples/langgraph/06_deploy_reheal.py`,
  wired into the `python-sdk` CI job. Proves end to end, deterministically, that a
  LangGraph graph's model dependency follows it across a node failure: a thread
  checkpointed on node A resumes on node B — which rehealed the model from the mesh —
  after A is killed. Echo fixture (the artifact is a blob, "serving" is `EchoBackend`);
  the real seam (`require_model` → mesh fetch + verify → `serve_model` bridge → routed
  resume) is exercised for real.
- **The deploy/reheal flagship, real-model half (rung 6, Ollama-manual)** —
  `examples/coop/src/bin/reheal_deploy.rs`: a governed GGUF reheals onto the surviving node and
  generates real tokens through routed inference after the origin dies. Composes `model_deploy`'s
  artifact-library machinery (signed weights + profile as content-addressed Blobs, `Provisioner` +
  `BlobRuntime`, live `llm/loading` percent) with `mycelium-reason`'s `serve_model` bridge and
  `InferenceRouter`: two provider depots each `supervise(profile, 1)` the model, so when the origin
  is killed the survivor elects on the bare `min=1` invariant, streams the weights afresh,
  `ollama create`s them, and re-serves the routable `llm/{model}` the app routes to. Manual (needs
  Ollama + a GGUF), excluded from `ci_smoke.sh` exactly like `model_deploy`. Honest single-machine
  caveat: A and B share one local Ollama daemon, so each creates under `{model}-{port}` — the
  streamed bytes + the Mycelium capability follow the thread (per-node Ollama for true multi-machine).
- **The LangGraph example ladder, rungs 0–5 (echo)** — five runnable, self-checking Python
  demos under `examples/langgraph/` completing the series below the flagship: `00_hello_skill`
  (a mesh skill is a LangChain `Runnable`), `01_typed` (`call_typed` through the mesh),
  `02_durable_state` (graph state survives a fresh client), `03_cross_node` (any node resumes
  any thread by gossip), and `05_traces` (replay/narrate routed inference) — plus a
  `examples/langgraph/README.md` ladder index and the echo-rung loop folded into the
  `python-sdk` CI job. Enabling surface for rung 5: `POST /gateway/reason/route` gained an
  optional `run_id` (mirrored by `ReasonClient.route(run_id=…)`) so a Python-driven routed
  call **records** its route + `llm_call` trace, fetchable via `/gateway/reason/trace`.
- **The Python tier of `mycelium-reason` (v3.0 Tiers 1+2)**:
  **`langgraph-checkpoint-mycelium`** (new package) — a LangGraph `BaseCheckpointSaver`
  backed by the mesh (index rows in gossiped KV under `ckpt/`/`ckptw/`, payloads as
  content-addressed blobs with free channel-value dedup; sync + async; cross-node resume
  of a real `StateGraph` proven in CI) — and **`mycelium.call_typed`** in `mycelium-py`
  (pydantic-validated skill output with a validation-feedback retry loop; pydantic via
  the `typed` extra). Driven by the repo's **first Python CI job** (`python-sdk`: a
  two-node `reason_node` mesh + pytest). The mesh blob fetch now answers the empty blob
  from its content address alone (a typed `None` payload serializes to zero bytes; an
  empty RPC reply means "miss", so it could never travel the wire).
- **The artifact library** (`mycelium-wasm-host`; design record
  [`docs/design/artifact-library.md`](docs/design/artifact-library.md)): a durable origin tier for
  content-addressed artifacts — `FsLibrarySource` (blob dir + signed `Manifest`;
  `Manifest::append_entry` is the one-call CI publish step), the **librarian** role
  (`spawn_librarian`: serve + `artifact/librarian` discovery + signature-scoped
  manifest→catalogue reconcile), `MeshArtifactSource::resolving` (holders discovered via the
  capability ring — no hardcoded node-ids), and the HTTP object-store source
  (`BlobFetcher` / `PrefetchingSource` / `HttpLibrarySource`, egress-gated before dispatch).
- **Artifact kinds + node runtimes**: `ArtifactKind` (WasmComponent | Blob) in a clean-slate
  versioned entry encoding; `ArtifactRuntime`/`Installed` traits — `WasmHost` becomes the engine
  inside one runtime; `BlobRuntime` places models/data (ranged streaming via
  `RangedArtifactSource`, complete-or-absent placement, activation hook, pluggable probe). The
  `Provisioner` gains a kind registry, async install reservations, **resource-aware
  eligibility** (signed per-entry `requires{disk,mem}`, `ResourceProbe` + headroom fraction,
  in-flight reservations counted), real `{ns}/loading` percent tiers, and a per-round **probe
  health pass** (fail → withdraw → reinstall).
- **Provenance binds the whole entry** (version‖kind‖artifact‖requirements‖capability): a signed
  artifact cannot be re-labeled under a different capability or kind, and resource requirements
  are tamper-evident (cost hints remain unsigned ranking inputs).
- **Examples**: `catalog` reworked honest (runtime-read library origin, librarian, origin death →
  peer-cache install); `mcp_toolgrowth` now installs real arriving code (new committed
  `unit_convert_component` fixture; activation-vs-installation taught explicitly); new **manual**
  `model_deploy` demo — real GGUF weights **and** their deployment profile as two signed
  artifacts (profile → weights by content address, design §4.3.1), activated into Ollama,
  generating real tokens under the governed profile.
- **Typed install errors**: `InstallError` is now an enum
  (`Fetch | Verify | Place | Activation | Resources | Host`) with a stable `stage()` label —
  callers match on cause instead of parsing strings.
- **Operator-visible artifact tripwires**: the provisioner/librarian emit
  `mycelium_artifact_*` counters through the `metrics` facade (ineligible-skip reasons,
  install started/completed/failed-by-stage, probe withdrawals, librarian publish/tombstone).
- **The CI flake tier** (`scripts/ci-retest.sh`): socket-binding suites re-run only their
  failed tests once — a deterministic failure still reds the build (fails twice); a flake
  keeps it green but emits a loud annotation (a bug report, never silence).

- **`subscribe_log_group` exact-once delivery across nodes** (#149; gate: overlay S11, verified
  6/6 green locally). The gateway consumer-group endpoint's "distributed lock" was a bare LWW
  gossip-KV write that returned a guard unconditionally — no mutual exclusion, so every cross-node
  subscriber "held" the claim and each drained the whole stream (100% double-delivery). Reworked to
  a **single-active** consumer chosen by a **leased consensus claim with converged-holder
  confirmation**: two near-simultaneous proposers can both *optimistically* commit (each checks only
  its local committed view), so the propose return isn't trusted — after committing, the node reads
  the **converged** committed holder (commit-keys are LWW-by-HLC, so exactly one converges) and only
  that node consumes; losers stand by without releasing (a tombstone would clear the winner's claim).
  The winner drains with a **private local offset** (exact-once by construction) and renews the
  lease; on its death the lease lapses and a standby takes over (failover). `SubscribeHandle` and its
  bare-LWW "lock" are removed. Contract clarified: `subscribe_log_group` is a single-active *log
  consumer*, **not** a load-balanced work queue (that is the `mycelium-tuple-space` companion) —
  pinned in the `runtime-invariants` "do not fix these" note so the dead-end isn't re-attempted.
- `mycelium-wiki` integration tests: the `free_port()` bind-race flake class retired
  (pair-granularity bind retries; `AddrInUse` CI failure 2026-07-07).
- `crossbeam-epoch` 0.9.18 → 0.9.20 (RUSTSEC-2026-0204; bench-only dependency path).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-07-04

The **v2.0 epoch** — all 16 milestones (M1–M16) shipped and signed off
([`docs/plans/v2.0.md`](docs/plans/v2.0.md)), plus the companion-crate ecosystem. First release since
`v1.2.0`. All workspace crates version in lockstep at `2.0.0` (a unified release train); the companion
crates (`mycelium-wiki` / `-blackboard` / `-tuple-space` / `-agentfacts` / `-wasm-host`) are newer than
the substrate and their APIs may still evolve within the 2.x line — pin exact versions if that matters.

### ⚠ Breaking changes (from `v1.2.0`)

- **Wire protocol `v10` → `v12`.** `v11` added `hlc_seq` to `Signal` (ordered delivery); `v12` replaced
  the full key→timestamp anti-entropy index with a fixed-width Merkle **`bucket_hashes`** digest. A
  `v1.2.0` node **cannot** interoperate with a `2.0.0` node except across the rolling-upgrade window —
  `read_frame` accepts `WIRE_VERSION = 12` **and** `PREV_WIRE_VERSION = 11` only.
- **Workspace restructure** — the substrate (Layers I+II) was extracted into a separate `mycelium-core`
  crate. `mycelium` re-exports an unchanged public Rust API, but consumers reaching internal module
  paths must update; and `consensus` (Layer III) is now behind a feature gate.
- **Serialization dependency** — the wire/WAL codec is the in-tree hand-rolled fixed-int codec
  (`mycelium-core::codec` / `serde_fixint`), **byte-identical** to the former `bincode`; `bincode` is
  fully removed from the dependency tree (RUSTSEC-2025-0141 no longer applies). This is *not* a wire or
  on-disk format change — persisted WAL/snapshots decode unchanged.

### Migration

- **Rolling upgrade is one step only.** A mixed `v11 ⇄ v12` cluster converges (a `v11` anti-entropy
  request downgrades to a full snapshot). Upgrading from `≤ v9` (i.e. `v1.2.0` and earlier) is a
  **stop-the-world** upgrade: drain, stop the cluster, deploy `2.0.0`, restart. WAL/snapshots persisted
  by the former codec load without migration.
- **No public API removals** in `mycelium` itself; new capability arrives behind additive feature flags.

  for a first customer engagement, [`docs/operations/customer-pilot.md`](docs/operations/customer-pilot.md).

### Added

- **`mycelium-wiki` companion crate** — a group-scoped, LLM-curated wiki: the durable, curated third coordination primitive (long-term-memory sibling of the blackboard's working memory), built on the public `mycelium` API only. **Control-plane / data-plane**: the corpus lives in a node-independent pluggable store (the `WikiStore` trait + an `FsStore` reference impl — manifest-last, torn-read-safe); a single elected **curator** serialises writes while group agents **read the store directly, in parallel** (no curator on the read path). Curator **election + ring-failover** on the capability ring; an evaporating KV **proposal queue** (`wiki/{group}/proposal/`); a **single-writer reconcile** that groups proposals by section (`DirectReconciler` lossless append-merge, or `LlmReconciler` 3-way merge behind `llm`); a **change-driven lint** loop (structural dead-cross-link/empty-section checks always on, LLM self-consistency behind `llm`; runs only after a write); **MCP tools** (`wiki.read`/`query`/`propose`) and an **HTTP gateway** (`/gateway/wiki/*`, feature `gateway`) with Python/TS `Wiki` SDKs; and a membership-gated **access broker** (`Wiki::request_store_access` → `StoreGrant`, RPC point-to-point). `Wiki::shutdown` reclaims the curator's background tasks. Features `control-plane` / `llm` / `gateway`; cross-node `tests/{failover,gateway,access}.rs` + the `wiki_chat` worked example (`ci_smoke.sh`, both use-case corpora). Audited in analysis Run 32 (one Major finding found + fixed same-session). Design/plan: `docs/plans/mycelium-wiki.md`; companion page `docs/wiki/dev/companions/wiki.md`.
- **Legible Emergence — coordinator-free fleet diagnosability** — make an emergent, coordinator-free fleet debuggable by a *non-designer* (Detect → Localize → Explain → Intervene) without a central collector: diagnostics are computed from each node's locally-held KV + HLC causal order + a **bounded** scatter-gather fan-out (`EXPLAIN_MAX_FANOUT`, with the skipped set *named* as `not_queried`, never silently dropped). Emergent tripwires + counters, a fleet snapshot, causal-order reconstruction, a fleet-state narrative, and the operator surface: `GET /gateway/explain` + `/gateway/diagnose` and the `make check` / `make check-full` pre-push gates. Phases 0–5. Plan: `docs/plans/legible-emergence.md`.
- **`mycelium-blackboard` companion crate** — content-routed shared working memory (the peer of the tuple space, routing by a **predicate over fact attributes** rather than lane position): `claim(predicate)` is a competitive, non-blocking destructive claim (Linda's `in`), `read`/`rd` is shared, `ack` is the idempotent terminal, `release`/deadline re-queues (at-least-once). `BoardStore` (WAL, magic `MBBWAL`) + `Blackboard` (roles + RPC + failover, `Post`/`Ack`-only replication). HTTP gateway `/gateway/bb/*`, Python/TS SDKs, the community-microgrid worked example. WS-G / G3. Plan: `docs/plans/v2-wsg-g3-blackboard.md`.
- **`mycelium-tuple-space` companion crate** — Linda-style pull-based pipeline buffer as a workspace member, built entirely on the public `mycelium` API (the composability proof: zero core changes were needed). Workers `take()` when ready, so readiness is self-announcing and the push-predict staleness/misroute failure mode does not exist. Single-lock store hot path; WAL durability with 4 record types (`Complete` is one indivisible record so a stage transition can never half-replay) and epoch'd compaction; `TupleRole::{Primary, Secondary, Auto, Client}` with secondary mirroring via replicate RPCs, heartbeat Signal, and promotion when the primary's capability evaporates; `Auto` elects with a lowest-candidate-id tie-break. Owns the `tuple/inflight/{ns}/{id}` and `sys/tuple/{node}/{ns}/…` KV prefixes. HTTP gateway (`/api/tuple`), Python and TypeScript SDKs, integration scenario 13. Design doc: `docs/plans/mycelium-tuple-space.md`.
- **TupleSpace WAL format header** — every tuple-space WAL now opens with `MTSWAL` magic + u16 LE version (v1). A file with a newer format version, or without the magic, is refused at open **byte-untouched** with an error naming both versions; previously an unrecognised record kind read as a torn tail and was silently truncated — an upgrade data-loss hazard. The header survives compaction, and the secondary replay-chunk cursor clamps past it. Format break is free: no earlier WAL shape was ever in a release.
- **HLC remote clock-drift bound** — `GossipConfig::max_clock_drift_ms` (also `GOSSIP_MAX_CLOCK_DRIFT_MS`; default 300 000 ms = 5 minutes, `0` disables). `Hlc::observe` now clamps remote physical time to `wall_now + bound`, with a rate-limited `warn!` naming the offending drift when the clamp engages. Previously one peer with a far-future clock (NTP failure, or hostile in a non-TLS cluster) dragged every node's HLC forward irrecoverably — the `max` never decays — and read-side evaporation, the substrate's failure detector (including tuple-space secondary promotion), was *silently suspended for the full drift duration*. The cited Kulkarni et al. 2014 HLC algorithm mandates exactly this bound. Documented trade-off in the `hlc` module: stamps beyond the bound waive the "local write after observe dominates remote" guarantee; store-level rejection of out-of-bound updates is deferred to the next wire-policy pass.
- **Symmetric capability-freshness window** — `CapEntry::is_fresh` / `ReqEntry::is_fresh` now also treat entries stamped further in the **future** than the 3× evaporation window as stale. A writer whose clock is persistently ahead by more than 3× its refresh interval quarantines itself instead of becoming un-evaporable; failure detection no longer depends on the sender's clock sanity. Regression gates: `observe_bounds_remote_clock_drift` (hlc), `future_stamped_entry_is_quarantined_not_fresh` (capability).
- **Commit-conflict tripwire** — the consensus listener now refuses to endorse a `COMMIT` carrying a *different* value for a slot whose existing commitment is still live (slots are commit-once; leased slots reopen only after expiry). Conflicts are logged at `warn!` and counted in `SystemStats::commit_conflicts` (also on `GET /stats`). Namespace ownership of `consensus/` remains promise-strength by design — the tripwire makes violations legible without teaching Layer I a Layer III law.
- **Epoch-leased commitments** — `ConsensusConfig::committed_lease_secs: Option<u64>`. When set, the commit also writes `consensus/lease/{slot}` (u64 LE ms) and lease expiry is evaluated **read-side** against the committed entry's HLC timestamp — the same evaporation convention as `CapEntry::is_fresh`, no background task, no renewal RPC. An expired lease reads as not-committed and the slot reopens for re-proposal. Renewal = re-proposing the same value while the lease is live (a fresh quorum round that refreshes the commit timestamp); a different value while live returns `Superseded`. Default `None` = permanent commitment (existing behaviour preserved). Lease-aware readers: `consensus_get`, `consistent_get`, `elect_leader` winner lookup, `GET /consensus/{slot}` (now also returns `lease_ms` + `lease_expired`); `consensus_rx` is deliberately the raw KV view.
- **Proposer-side clobber guard** — `try_commit_if_ready` and `cross_propose` now return `Superseded` instead of overwriting when a *different* live commitment landed between the supersession check and quorum (a lost race with another proposer).

### Security

- **Decode allocation bound (remote DoS fix)** — `bincode_cfg()` now sets `.with_limit::<MAX_FRAME_BYTES>()`. Without it, a frame whose internal length prefix claimed a huge element count drove an unbounded `Vec::with_capacity` and the process OOM-aborted (SIGABRT) — one malformed frame from any connected peer, or a bit-flip on a non-TLS link, killed the node. `read_frame` capped the frame size but not the element counts decoded from inside it. All decoders share the config, so the whole wire surface (gossip, capability, signal, locality, WAL sync) was exposed. Found by a decoder mini-fuzz now kept in-suite (`mini_fuzz_decoders_survive_adversarial_bytes`, `fuzz-internals` feature) and wired into CI — the `fuzz/` targets existed but had never run in CI.
- **Dependency advisories cleared** (lockfile bumps, no manifest changes): `bytes` 1.10.1 → 1.11.1 (RUSTSEC-2026-0007, integer overflow in `BytesMut::reserve` — `read_frame` calls `reserve` on the wire path, though the 10 MiB frame cap already bounded the input), `tracing-subscriber` 0.3.19 → 0.3.20 (RUSTSEC-2025-0055, ANSI-escape log poisoning), `tokio` 1.44.1 → 1.46.1 (RUSTSEC-2025-0023, broadcast-channel unsoundness). `cargo audit` now reports zero vulnerabilities; remaining unmaintained-crate warnings (notably `bincode`, the wire codec) are tracked as a roadmap concern.

### Added

- **A2A agent card: schema-aware skills** — `GET /.well-known/agent.json` now populates each skill's `description` from its gossiped input schema (`skills/{ns}/{name}/{node}/input`, published by SkillRunner) and exposes the raw JSON Schema as an additive `inputSchema` field. Tool-calling frameworks build properly-typed tools from it instead of guessing payload shapes from prose — previously the empty description left LangChain/AutoGen agents passing plain text to JSON-expecting skills, which failed with a parse error and let the agent silently fall back to answering from its own weights. The bundled `examples/a2a_langchain/` agents (ported to LangChain ≥ 1.0 `create_agent` and current AutoGen) now derive their tool signatures from `inputSchema`.

- **Demo smoke in CI** — `examples/community/ci_smoke.sh` runs the community cluster against a deterministic mock LLM (`mock_llm.py`, stdlib-only, OpenAI-compatible) on every push: 4-skill convergence, schema-aware agent card, A2A + dashboard router coexistence, the full orchestrator → researcher → writer tool-call pipeline, and SIGTERM cleanup. Each assertion is a regression gate for one of the four bugs the 2026-06-11 live run-through found; the mock additionally rejects non-string chat content exactly as Ollama does, so the tool-result coercion fix cannot silently regress. SkillRunner now **re-asserts its gossiped input/output schemas periodically** (ttl/4, ≥ 5 s) like capability advertisements — a one-shot startup write could race peer-connection establishment and leave tool discovery incomplete for tens of seconds (observed 1-in-3 under load; 8/8 clean after).

### Added (observability)

- **`individual_flood_fallbacks` counter** — on `SystemStats` and `GET /stats`. Counts Individual-scoped frames (RPC requests/responses, consensus votes) that had no direct sender→target route and fell back to flooding — plus, with a rate-limited `warn!`, the residual case of an Individual frame dropped with zero peers. Non-zero under steady state is correct behaviour but signals topology pressure: RPC-heavy pairs without direct peering pay relay latency. Companion to the flood-fallback fix below; the resilience scale test gains a Phase 1b cross-worker RPC gate that exercises exactly this path under `GOSSIP_MAX_ACTIVE_CONNECTIONS`-capped partial meshes.

### Changed

- **AFN fluid-pipeline demo migrated to the pull pattern** — `examples/fluid_pipeline/` now runs the canonical tuple-space architecture by default: workers `take()` from the deepest stage and `complete()` into the next (fluidity = self-selection against per-stage depth), and the former coordinator collapses into a seeder/sink edge client. The original coordinator-dispatch architecture — the project's own named anti-pattern — is retained behind `PIPELINE_MODE=push` as the comparison baseline for the push→pull refinement (`flow_networks.html`, Paper 2a). New `ci_smoke.sh` runs both modes end-to-end as local processes (3 nodes, 24 items, fresh cluster per mode) and is wired into CI as the `afn-smoke` job, so both distribution models are regression-gated.

- **`/gateway/llm/call` reports failures via HTTP status codes** — 404 (`no_provider`), 502 (provider-side error, incl. `parse_error`), 504 (RPC `timeout`); the `{"error":...,"detail":...}` JSON body is unchanged. The endpoint was the gateway's one 200-on-error outlier (every other handler already used `BAD_REQUEST`/`NOT_FOUND`/`GATEWAY_TIMEOUT`), which made failures invisible to `curl -f` and `raise_for_status()` callers — integration scenario 12's flake diagnostic was an empty `{}` for exactly this reason. The SSE `/gateway/llm/stream` endpoint deliberately keeps in-stream `{"type":"error"}` events: the status line is committed before the stream body. SDKs already throw/raise on non-2xx; the Python docstring now documents the raising behaviour. Regression test: `test_llm_call_no_provider_returns_404`.
- **`writer_channel_depth` default raised 256 → 1024** — both scale tests recorded dropped frames at burst (56 at 100 nodes / depth 2048 override; 92 at 5 000-key bulk / depth 4096 override), and the doc comment's own budget math (`N × F` at fan-out 4, N = 256) says 1024. Channel memory is per in-flight frame, not preallocated, so idle cost is nil. Bulk-write workloads should still override to 4096+ via `GOSSIP_WRITER_CHANNEL_DEPTH`.

### Fixed

- **Fan-out activation was polled, not event-driven — inbound-only nodes were mute for live sends for up to two health-check intervals** — the gossip loop's send-target list comes from a watch channel that only the health monitor published (10 s default cadence, plus a change-check that can skip the first tick), while peers are learned on Ping receipt. A node with no outbound dials — a seed, a tuple-space primary, any pure listener — could not send *anything* live (signals, RPC responses, consensus votes) to freshly-connected peers until the cadences aligned: worst case ≈ 2× `health_check_interval`. Anti-entropy silently healed KV, which is why this never surfaced; one-shot Individual frames (RPC replies!) just timed out. Found by the new random-topology property test (`test_individual_consumers_over_random_partial_meshes`: relay delivery worked at "attempt 7" on one graph — exactly a health tick — and never within 8 s on another). Fix: the connection handler publishes the updated peer list at insertion time; the health monitor remains the steady-state reconciler/evictor. All three graphs now deliver on attempt 0.
- **Individual-scoped signals silently dropped when the target was not in the sender's outbound peer list** — with `group_aware_forwarding` (default on), `ForwardHint::Individual` sent the frame *only* to a directly-peered target and otherwise to nobody: the signal never entered the medium. Individual scope carries RPC requests, RPC responses, and consensus votes, so in any partial mesh — exactly what `GOSSIP_MAX_ACTIVE_CONNECTIONS` (the documented iptables mitigation) and `max_forwarding_peers` produce — RPCs timed out and ballots starved between non-peered pairs, with nothing logged. This also contradicted the architecture's stated model (forwarding is unconditional; only *admission* is scoped — `Boundary::admits`). The targeted send is kept as an optimization when a direct route exists; otherwise the frame now falls back to unconditional flooding (each hop applies the same rule; the seen-set dedups, hop-TTL bounds it). Found during the three-arm experiment bring-up: a synchronized first-`take` volley wedged all workers for the full RPC deadline whenever responses raced route establishment. Regression test: `test_individual_signal_reaches_unpeered_target_via_relay` (line topology A→B→C; fails pre-fix).
- **Tombstone GC never fired since the v9 HLC migration (2026-05-20)** — the GC predicate compared the store entry's *packed HLC* timestamp (`(physical_ms << 16) | logical`) against a wall-clock-*millisecond* cutoff; a packed stamp is ~65 536× any ms cutoff, so the condition was unsatisfiable and every tombstone accumulated forever (unbounded store growth on delete-heavy workloads). Every other timestamp consumer (`CapEntry::is_fresh`, seen-set eviction) unpacks via `hlc::physical_ms`; the GC was the one that didn't. The sweep is extracted to `store::sweep_stale_tombstones` (unpacks correctly, preserves the conditional-remove discipline from the race-family fix below). Found by an M2 Run-21 falsification probe; regression test `tombstone_gc_sweep_unpacks_hlc_timestamps`.
- **TypeScript SDK: `shardFor()` crashed on every call** — it referenced `this._base` (the property is `base`) and omitted the path's leading slash; plus 7 further `tsc` errors from assigning fetch's `unknown` JSON to typed values. CI now runs `tsc --noEmit` over `mycelium-ts` (new `sdk-ts` job) so the SDK can't ship type-broken again, and a dedicated time-boxed `cargo fuzz` job covers the wire/capability decoders that the in-suite mini-fuzz samples more shallowly.
- **`with_http_routes` replaced earlier routers instead of merging** — the extra-routes slot was last-caller-wins, so composing registrations silently dropped all but the final one. Concretely: SkillRunner registers `with_a2a()` and then its management dashboard, and the dashboard erased the A2A endpoints — `/.well-known/agent.json` 404'd in exactly the documented A2A setup. Routers are now merged (`Router::merge`); regression test `with_http_routes_merges_across_calls`.
- **A2A `tasks/send` server-side timeout raised 30 s → 120 s** — A2A skills are frequently multi-step LLM pipelines (orchestrator → researcher → writer takes ~90 s on local Ollama); the 30 s cap made every such composition return `-32603 rpc call failed` while the pipeline was still working.
- **SkillRunner: tool results sent to chat APIs as raw JSON** — tool-role messages carried `content` as a JSON *object* when a tool returned structured output; Ollama rejects non-string content (`invalid message content type: map[string]interface {}`), breaking every skill→skill composition whose callee returns JSON. Tool results are now coerced to strings, same as user input already was.
- **SkillRunner survived SIGTERM indefinitely** — the shutdown task drained the agent but the skill loop never returns, and the consumed signal suppressed the default terminate action. Generations of "stopped" skillrunners accumulated invisibly across demo runs, with `SO_REUSEPORT` letting every generation keep sharing the same ports (old binaries answered a fraction of requests). The shutdown task now exits the process after the agent drains; demo `stop.sh` gained an orphan sweep.
- **Example/demo repairs from a live run-through** — `mesh_demo` referenced manifests at a path renamed long ago (hidden by cargo's incremental cache; examples now built in CI); the community demo's convergence check counted a KV prefix that cannot match the real `cap/{node}/{ns}/{name}` key shape; `invoke.sh`'s fallback caller hardcoded the `llm/hello` smoke-test capability (now driven by `SKILL_CAP`/`SKILL_PAYLOAD`); cold-start bind races in `start.sh`/`demo.sh` (spokes now wait for the seed's port); `a2a_langchain/requirements.txt` used a non-portable `file:` relative reference.
- **Prefix-index divergence under concurrent tombstone/insert** — `apply_and_notify` maintained the secondary structures (`prefix_index`, `cap_ns_index`, `peer_localities`) *after* the lock-free store CAS, derived from the update being applied. Two winning writers to the same key could interleave their index ops in the opposite order of their CASes — e.g. a delete racing a higher-timestamp rewrite arriving on another shard — leaving a live store key permanently invisible to `scan_prefix` and capability resolution. Anti-entropy could not repair it (re-applying the same `(key, ts)` loses LWW and never touches the index); only a later rewrite of the key did. Index maintenance is now a *reconcile*: under a per-key-hash stripe lock (`KvStore::index_stripes`, 64 stripes), the writer re-reads the stored entry and sets membership in every secondary structure to match it, so the final index state always matches the final store state. Found by an M2 falsification probe (86 of 100 000 racing rounds reproduced the loss); the probe and an 8-thread mixed-churn consistency test are kept as regression gates.
- **Signal handler registration could panic under contention** — the `HandlerTable` registration closure moved its sender into the map via a single-use `slot.take().expect(...)` inside a papaya `compute`. papaya re-invokes the closure when the entry changes concurrently, so two tasks registering the same signal kind simultaneously (or one racing the closed-sender eviction in delivery) panicked on the retry. The closure now clones the sender per invocation. Regression test: `concurrent_same_kind_signal_registration_does_not_panic` (reproduced the panic instantly pre-fix).
- **Concurrent `set_with_min_acks` on the same key starved each other** — the per-key tracker slot was single-occupancy: a second concurrent caller overwrote the first caller's tracker, and the first caller's unconditional cleanup then deleted the second's — both could report spurious timeouts while the acks arrived. Each key now holds a copy-on-write *list* of trackers (`kv_quorum::{install_tracker, remove_tracker}`): every inbound update is observed by all in-flight callers and each caller removes exactly its own tracker by `Arc` identity. Applies to both the Rust API and the HTTP gateway endpoint.
- **Prompt-skill registration races** (`llm` feature) — (1) two first registrations racing could both observe an empty registry and spawn two `llm.invoke` dispatch loops, each receiving every invoke signal (duplicate RPC responses); the spawn is now gated by an atomic swap. (2) Dropping a stale `PromptSkillHandle` after the same skill id had been re-registered deleted the *new* backend from the registry; the cancellation path now removes only if the registry still holds the backend it registered.
- **A2A task cleanup could evict a live task** — the 5-minute sweep collected stale task ids and then removed them unconditionally; a status update re-inserting the task with a fresh `created_at` between collect and removal was evicted, and clients polling the task got NotFound. The sweep now uses a conditional `compute` (remove only if still stale at removal time).
- **Tombstone GC could delete a concurrent live write** — the GC task collected stale-tombstone keys and then removed them *unconditionally*; a live write winning the store CAS on the same key between collect and removal was deleted outright (recoverable only via anti-entropy from a peer). Same race family as the prefix-index fix above. The removal is now a conditional `compute`: the entry is removed only if it is still a stale tombstone at removal time.
- **LWW equal-timestamp divergence** — concurrent data writes to the same key carrying *identical* HLC timestamps (two writers in the same wall-clock millisecond whose clocks had not yet observed each other) previously resolved by arrival order: each node kept whichever value it applied first, diverging permanently — and undetectably, because the anti-entropy digest hashes `(key, timestamp)` only and was identical on both sides. `lww_wins` now breaks data-vs-data timestamp ties deterministically (lexicographically greater value wins), so apply order no longer matters. Tombstone tie rules are unchanged (tombstone still wins ties; data never resurrects a tombstone on a tie). Rolling-upgrade note: nodes on older versions lack the tiebreak, so a mixed cluster retains the old exposure on exact ties until fully upgraded — no worse than before.
- **Consensus listener registration race** — `start_consensus_listener` now registers the PROPOSE/COMMIT signal receivers synchronously before spawning the voter task. Previously registration happened inside the task's first poll, so a proposal arriving in the startup window was silently dropped and the node failed to vote on it.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Per-peer gossip rate-limiting** — `GossipConfig::max_inbound_frames_per_sec` (also `GOSSIP_MAX_INBOUND_FRAMES_PER_SEC` env var). When set to a non-zero value, frames received faster than this rate from a single peer are dropped with a warning log. Prevents a malicious or misbehaving peer from flooding the inbound processing pipeline. Default `0` = unlimited (existing behaviour preserved).
- **`bulk_serve` handler concurrency cap** — `GossipConfig::max_concurrent_bulk_handlers` (also `GOSSIP_MAX_CONCURRENT_BULK_HANDLERS` env var). Limits the number of concurrent per-request background tasks spawned by `bulk_serve` via a `tokio::sync::Semaphore`. When the cap is reached, new bulk signals are dropped with a warning. Default `64`; set to `0` for unlimited.

### Changed

- **`GossipError::Config(String)` replaced by three structured variants** — `InvalidField { field: &'static str, reason: String }`, `FieldConflict { field_a, field_b, reason }`, `NodeIdMismatch { node_id, bind_addr }`. Callers can now match specific configuration failures without parsing error strings. All `validate()` and `apply_env_overrides()` error paths updated.
- **`GossipError::Network(String)` replaced by two structured variants** — `FrameTooLarge { size: usize, limit: usize }` and `UnsupportedWireVersion { received: u8, current: u8, prev: u8, hint: &'static str }`. Framing errors are now fully typed; callers can distinguish oversized frames from version mismatches.

### Added

- **HTTP gateway bearer-token authentication** — `GossipConfig::gateway_auth_token: Option<String>` (also `GOSSIP_GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN` env var). When set, every `/gateway/**` request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; unauthenticated requests receive `401 Unauthorized`. Health, ready, stats, and metrics endpoints are always public. Suitable for deployments where `http_addr = "0.0.0.0"`.
- **Error handling guide** — `docs/guide/error-handling.md` documents all eight public error types (`GossipError`, `ConsistencyError`, `RpcError`, `QuorumError`, `ScatterError`, `SchemaError`, `BulkError`, `ShardError`), their recoverability classification, propagation strategy, and a relationship diagram per handle.
- **100-node scale test** — `make test-scale` starts a 100-node Docker cluster (1 seed + 99 workers + mgmt + runner), validates full gossip convergence, KV propagation (seed write → mgmt read), and zero dropped frames. Override size with `make test-scale SCALE_WORKERS=49`. Compose file at `tests/integration/docker-compose.scale.yml`; runner script at `tests/integration/run_scale.sh`.
- **`LlmHandle`** (via `agent.llm()`) — typed handle for LLM prompt-skill operations: `register_prompt_skill`, `call_prompt_skill`, `update_prompt`, `get_prompt`, `list_prompts`, `delete_prompt`. Available under `--features llm`.
- **`McpHandle`** (via `agent.mcp()`) — typed handle for MCP tool bridge operations: `register_mcp_tool` (server-role tool registration), `connect_mcp_server` (client-role tool discovery and proxying). `connect_mcp_server` requires `--features gateway`.
- **`CapEntry` re-exported** from crate root — allows external tooling and benches to encode/decode capability entries from the gossip KV namespace.
- **`#[non_exhaustive]` on all public error and result enums** — `GossipError`, `ConsistencyError`, `RpcError`, `QuorumError`, `ScatterError`, `SchemaError`, `BulkError`, `ShardError`, `McpError` are now `#[non_exhaustive]`. Adding new variants in future releases will not break exhaustive `match` arms in downstream code.
- **Wire rolling-upgrade test** — `read_frame_accepts_prev_wire_version` in `src/framing.rs` verifies that v10 Signal frames (no `hlc_seq`) are accepted by `read_frame`, decoded via `WireMessageV10`, and converted to `WireMessage::Signal { hlc_seq: None }`.
- **`Capability::encode()` / `CapEntry::encode()` made public** — these were `pub(crate)`; now `pub` so external tooling can serialise capability entries for seeding or testing.
- **Capability-resolve benchmark** (`benches/throughput.rs`) — measures `capabilities().resolve()` against 1/10/50/100 pre-seeded providers; shows O(providers) scan cost.
- **KV payload-size benchmark** (`benches/throughput.rs`) — measures `kv().set()` at 64 / 1 024 / 65 536 byte payloads; exercises the framing encode path at representative sizes.
- **Typed sub-handle facade** — `GossipAgent` exposes eight domain-scoped handles, each a zero-cost `Arc<TaskCtx>` clone: `KvHandle` (via `agent.kv()`), `MeshHandle` (via `agent.mesh()`), `CapabilitiesHandle` (via `agent.capabilities()`), `ConsensusHandle` (via `agent.consensus()`), `ServiceHandle` (via `agent.service()`), `SchemaHandle` (via `agent.schemas()`), `LlmHandle` (via `agent.llm()`), `McpHandle` (via `agent.mcp()`). All domain methods live exclusively on their typed handle; `GossipAgent` retains only lifecycle and utility methods.
- `gateway` Cargo feature (on by default) — gates the Axum HTTP server and its transitive deps (`axum`, `tower-http`, `tokio-stream`, `futures-util`). Disable with `default-features = false` for bare-metal / WASM embeds. All gossip, KV, signal, consensus, capability, and service APIs compile without `gateway`.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` — pins the toolchain to `stable`.

### Changed

- `GossipError::State(String)` replaced by two structured variants: `GossipError::AlreadyRunning` (called `start()` on a running agent) and `GossipError::Shutdown` (called `start()` after shutdown). Callers can now match lifecycle errors without parsing strings.
- `set_quorum` renamed to `set_with_min_acks` — name now reflects the actual semantics (wait for N gossip echo receipts, not consensus quorum).
- Cargo.toml `description` improved: now accurately describes the three-layer substrate.
- `a2a` and `llm` features now imply `gateway` (they expose HTTP endpoints).

### Added

- `Capability::with_schema_id` / `CapFilter::with_schema` — optional contract version gossip-propagated with every capability entry. Resolvers that call `with_schema` only match providers advertising the same `schema_id`; capabilities without a `schema_id` do not match (strict by default).
- `Capability::with_input_schema` / `with_output_schema` — embed JSON Schema strings directly in the gossip-propagated capability entry so callers can inspect the invocation contract from `resolve()` results without a separate KV lookup. SkillRunner now embeds `.skill.toml` input/output schemas in the capability in addition to the existing `skills/.../input` KV keys.
- `GossipAgent::signal_rx_from(kind, trusted)` — delivers only signals whose `sender` is in the trusted list. Addresses the semantic-injection attack vector (arXiv 2511.19699 §5.1) for LLM-driven agents processing signal payloads as prompts. Empty `trusted` list delegates to the unfiltered path with no overhead.
- Speech act taxonomy in the crate-level doc comment: maps FIPA-ACL performatives to Mycelium primitives.
- `examples/semantic_coordination.rs` — in-process example demonstrating all three features.
- `GossipAgent::publish_schema(schema_id, json_bytes)` — validates JSON, conflict-detects against the existing `schemas/{id}` KV entry, and writes only on `Published`. Returns `SchemaPublishResult::{Published, Unchanged, Conflict}`.
- `GossipAgent::force_publish_schema` — overwrites without conflict detection; intended for dev / migration tooling.
- `GossipAgent::get_schema(schema_id)` — retrieves authoritative schema bytes from the KV ring.
- `GossipAgent::list_schemas()` — enumerates the full schema catalogue sorted by ID.
- `GossipAgent::seed_schemas_from_dir(path)` — seeds all `*.json` files from a directory tree; file path relative to `dir` (without extension) becomes the `schema_id`.
- `SchemaPublishResult` / `SchemaError` public types.
- `schemas/{schema_id}` added to the KV namespace ownership table.
- Wire v11: `hlc_seq: Option<u64>` added to `WireMessage::Signal` for causal ordering via `emit_ordered()`. v10 rolling-upgrade shim decodes v10 frames with `hlc_seq = None`.
- `emit_ordered()` — stamps an HLC sequence number on the signal frame; receivers with `signal_ordered_delivery = true` buffer per `(sender, kind)` and deliver in ascending HLC order.
- Watcher C2: consolidated requirement opacity watcher — one task and one `cap/` subscription for all declared requirements on a node (previously one task per `declare_requirement` call).

### Fixed

- `publish_schema` / `force_publish_schema` now validate `schema_id` and reject empty IDs, leading/trailing `/`, `//`, `.`/`..` path segments, and non-ASCII characters. `SchemaError::InvalidSchemaId` variant added.
- GC task now proactively evicts closed `prefix_watchers` and `prefix_predicate_watchers` entries on every GC cycle, preventing accumulation of dead senders when the prefix never receives a write after the subscriber drops.
- GC task now evicts orphaned `quorum_trackers` entries (those whose caller future was dropped mid-wait, leaving a dangling tracker with no live waiter).
- Signal reorder buffer now logs a `warn!` when a depth-based flush degrades causal ordering (`max_depth` exceeded). Previously this was silent.
- `rpc_pending` mutex `.lock()` calls now recover from a poisoned mutex rather than panicking, preventing a cascade failure when a panic occurs in a concurrent task.
