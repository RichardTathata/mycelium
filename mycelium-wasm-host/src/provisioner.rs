//! The **provisioner** — the app-layer loop that *closes* the autonomic loop (M15 item 4):
//! watch demand → resolve unmet requirements against the installable catalog → dispatch to the
//! matching [`ArtifactRuntime`] (pull + verify + install) → advertise, so demand is relieved.
//!
//! **Core Principle 1 (no coordinator).** This is a regular agent built on Mycelium's public API,
//! **not** a substrate mechanism. The library never auto-provisions; the agency to pull-and-run is
//! the node's own local choice. No coordinator assigns provisioning duty — every node runs its own
//! provisioner, each independently observes demand and **self-elects** (probabilistically, to damp
//! the thundering herd; any over-provisioning self-corrects when a future governor sheds providers
//! over `max`). This generalises `demand.rs`'s "the library never auto-advertises" stance.
//!
//! **Kind dispatch (`docs/design/artifact-library.md` §4).** The convergence loops here are
//! kind-agnostic — they reason about capabilities, demand, and provider counts. *How* an artifact
//! becomes live is the registered [`ArtifactRuntime`]'s business: `WasmComponent` instantiates in
//! the sandboxed host, `Blob` places bytes for a node-local runtime. A node without a runtime for
//! an entry's kind (or whose install budget the entry exceeds) silently never self-elects for it —
//! **eligibility is node-local truth** — and a tripwire counter records the skip (detection, not
//! prevention). Installs run as **background tasks against an `Installing` reservation**, so a
//! multi-GB pull never blocks the provision tick and a round never double-starts an artifact.
